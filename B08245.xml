            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Which though it be true in many, yet thoſe great ones of <hi>Indus</hi> and <hi>Ganges,</hi> and <hi>Danubius, Rhenes,</hi> and <hi>Nylus,</hi> are littie or nothing varied from the ſame courſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and currents which they held Thouſand of years ſince, as appears in their diſcriptions by the Ancient <hi>Geographers;</hi> but above all methinks the conſtant riſing of <hi>Nylus</hi> continued for ſo many Ages, is one of the greateſt wonders in the World, which is ſo preciſe in regard of time, that if you take of the Earth adjoyning of the River and preſerve it carefully, that it come nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be wet nor waſted, and weigh it daily, you ſhall find it neither more nor leſs heavy till the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>June,</hi> at which day it beginneth to grow more ponderous, and Augmenteth with the Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the River, whereby they have an infalible Knowledge of the ſtate of the Deluge. This Mr. <hi>George Sandys</hi> reports, and <hi>Alpinus</hi> a Phyſitian names it as a common experiment. Whereas heretofore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been made of the Sea and flowing of Waters, and divers other motions, it may be convenient to add hereunto the ſayings and writings of the moſt expert Learned Perſon <hi>Fredericus Delphinus,</hi> Doctor of Arts and Phyſick, and publick profeſſor of the Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sciences in <hi>Padua,</hi> touching the flowing and reflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or increaſe or decreaſe (otherwiſe alſo named ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and receſs) that is, coming and going, or ebbing and flowing of the Water of the Sea. Which flowing and reflowing, ſome do alſo name, the falſe reſt or qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, or inordinate motion of the Water of the Sea. And albeit divers men have Treated of this Subject, yet foraſmuch as ſome of their writings are ſomewhat too dark, and not eaſie of Men to be underſtood, I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:187773:5"/> have thought neceſſary, partly out of their Writings, and partly by my own Induſtry, more clearly and larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Treat thereof, that the ſame may be the better underſtood of all men.</p>
            <p>Therefore for the more eaſie underſtanding of theſe two manner of motions of the Water of the Sea, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moving of the Sun and Moon, to the moving of the <hi>Primum Mobile.</hi> The firſt moveable, is firſt to be known, that whereſoever a man is on the Earth, his Horizon ever cutteth or divideth the Heaven to him into two halfs, and the one half of Heaven is ever above his Horizon, and the other half beneath, and whereas in the half of a Sperical or round Body, are contained two quarters, two ſhall ever be above his Horizon, and two beneath; thoſe that are above the Horizon, are called diurnall or day quarters: and they that are under the Horizon, are called the Nocturnal or Night quarters. Of theſe four quarters of Heaven, are two of which is made the flowing or increaſe of the Water of the Sea: and other two in which is made the flowing or increaſe of the Water of the Sea: and other two in which is made the flowing or decreaſe of the Sea. The quarters in the which is made the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the quarter which is from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to the <hi>South</hi> above the Horizon, which is the quarter of the day acceſs, or increaſe of the day: and the quarter oppoſite or contrary, which is from the <hi>Weſt</hi> to midnight under the Horizon, which is the quarter of the night acceſs. The quarters in which is made the reflowing or decreſe, is the quarter which is from the <hi>South</hi> to the <hi>Weſt</hi> above the Horizon, which is the quarter of the receſs of the day: and the quarter oppoſite, which is from midnight to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> under the Horizon in the quarter of the receſs of the night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is alſo to be known, that there are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven eight points of the flowing and reflowing, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or decreaſe of the Sea: of the which, four are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:187773:5"/> ſtrong, and four are weak, two are weak for the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and two for the reflowing; weak for flowing, are the points of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> which are the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the two quarters of flowing: weak for reflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the point of the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>Midday,</hi> and the point of <hi>Midnight,</hi> which are the begining of the quarters of reflowing: and theſe four are diſtant the one from the other, by a quarter of Heaven. Of the ſtrong points, two are ſtrong for flowing, and two for reflowing. Strong for the flowing, is the middle point between the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and the <hi>South,</hi> being diſtant from the <hi>East</hi> 45 degrees, and from the <hi>South</hi> likewiſe, and the middle point between the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>Midnight,</hi> in the night quarter of flowing, being diſtant from the <hi>West</hi> 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and from <hi>Midnight</hi> in the ſame manner. Points ſtrong for the reflowing, is the middle point between the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> in the day quarter of the reflowing, being diſtant from the <hi>South</hi> 45 degrees, and from the <hi>Weſt</hi> likewiſe: And the <hi>Middle</hi> point, between <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in the quarter of the night reflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being diſtant from <hi>Midnight</hi> 45 degrees, and from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> likewiſe.

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is to be known, that beſides the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid eight Points, to ſuch as have a right Horizon, there are many other Points equipolent or of equal virtue.

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are alſo to take notice, that the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> every month are together in one ſigne, degree, and minute. And this ſo being, is called the conjunction of the <hi>Moon</hi> with the <hi>Sun.</hi> From thence for the ſpace of eight days, or thereabout, the <hi>Moon</hi> is departed from the <hi>Sun,</hi> by her proper motion by a fourth part of Heaven: and this departing is called the firſt quarter of the <hi>Moon</hi> with the <hi>Sun.</hi> From thence about fourteen days, or near upon, ſhe is departed from the <hi>Sun</hi> another fourth part of Heaven, and ſo by the half of Heaven: and this diſtance is called the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Moon</hi> with the <hi>Sun,</hi> by the full <hi>Moon.</hi> From thence to 21 days, or thereabouts, ſhe is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her oppoſition with the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Full moon</hi> by another fourth part of the Heaven, coming toward the <hi>Sun:</hi> and this diſtance is called the ſecond quadrature of the <hi>Moon</hi> with the <hi>Sun,</hi> and then the <hi>Moon</hi> is diſtant from the <hi>Sun</hi> by a fourth part of the Heaven, as it was diſtant in the firſt quarter, and ſo cometh near to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the <hi>Sun.</hi> From thence at 30 days, or thereabouts, the <hi>Moon</hi> is again in conjunction with the <hi>Sun</hi> as ſhe was at the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and laſtly, We are to take notice that the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>moon,</hi> both together every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral day (which is the time of 24 hours to the moving of the firſt moveable) are the cauſes of flowing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing, or the increaſe or deceaſe of the Water of the Sea twice. The declarations premiſed, and well kept in memorie, Let us declare how the <hi>ſun</hi> and <hi>moon</hi> both together every natural day, to the moving of the firſt moveable, are the cauſes of the flowing and reflowing of the Sea. For if all theſe declarations are well kept in memory, and eſpecially the quarters of the Heaven in which is the flowing, and the quarters of Heaven in which is the reflowing, and which are the ſtrongeſt Points for the flowing, and ſtrong Points for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing: Theſe (I ſay) being kept in memory, all the

            <p>Firſt of all therefore (as touching the flowing and reflowing of the Sea, to the moving of the firſt movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it is to be known, that when the <hi>ſun</hi> and the <hi>moon,</hi> are joyned together, which conjunction is called <hi>Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunium</hi> (that is) the new <hi>moon,</hi> when they are moved to the moving of the firſt moveable, from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to the <hi>South,</hi> becauſe the virtues both of the <hi>ſun</hi> and <hi>moon</hi> are united together, and both theſe Luminaries are moved continually in the moving of the firſt movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the quarters of the day flowing, which is from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to the <hi>Weſt;</hi> the day flowing or encreaſe of the Sea is continued; and while they move from the <hi>South</hi> to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> becauſe they are moved continually by the day quarter of the reflowing, the reflowing ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth; and while they are moved from the <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Midnight,</hi> becauſe they are then moved by the quarter of the night flowing. The night flowing is again continual, and while they are moved from <hi>midnight</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> becauſe they are then moved by the night quarter of reflowing, the night reflowing is again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall: and thus twice in the natural day is the flowing or encreaſe, and twice the reflowing or decreaſe of the Water of the Sea.</p>
            <p>It is again ſecondarily to he known, that when the <hi>moon</hi> after her conjunction with the <hi>ſun,</hi> by her proper motion is departed from the <hi>ſun</hi> towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> according to the order of the ſigns, going towards the firſt quadrature of <hi>ſun</hi> (which the <hi>Italian</hi> Pilots call 41 quartirone) ever before the <hi>moon</hi> by her proper motion come to the firſt quarter, which is the diſtance of the <hi>moon</hi> from the <hi>ſun</hi> towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> according to the order of the ſigns, by a quarter or fourth part of the Heaven; when the <hi>ſun</hi> is ſo much above the Horizon of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> part in the quarter of the day flowing, how much the <hi>moon</hi> is under the Horizon in the ſame part of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> in the quarter of the night reflowing, becauſe then the <hi>ſun</hi> is ſo much diſtant from the ſtrong point of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:187773:7"/> the flowing above the Horizon, they are equipollent and of equal virtue, therefore then is neither flowing nor reflowing of the Water of the Sea, but the Water ſeemeth to ſtand: which the <hi>Venetians</hi> call <hi>L' aqua e' ſtanca.</hi> But when the <hi>ſun</hi> by the motion of the firſt moveable, cometh near to the ſtrong Point of flowing, which is above the Horizon in the day quarter of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>moon</hi> by the ſame motion of the firſt movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, departeth ſo much from the <hi>ſouth</hi> Point of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing, which is under the Horizon in the night quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the reflowing, coming towards the weak Point of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> flowing, then is the <hi>moon</hi> in the ſtrong point of reflowing, which is under the Horizon in the night quarter of the reflowing, the reflowing is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the flowing is fortifyed: And then the Water of the Sea begineth to flow. And how much more the <hi>ſun</hi> approacheth to the ſtrong point of flowing, which is above the Horizon in the day quarter of flowing, ſo much more the <hi>moon</hi> is departed rom the ſtrong Point of the reflowing, which is under the Horizon in the night quarter of the reflowing, approaching to the weak Point of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> flowing, and therefore the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continueth. But when the <hi>ſun</hi> by the motion of the firſt moveable, cometh to the ſtrong point of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is above the Horizon in the day quarter of the flowing; then the <hi>moon</hi> is departed from the ſtrong Point of the reflowing, which is under the Horizon in the night quarter of reflowing, and is made near to the Point of the <hi>Eeaſt</hi> flowing, and therefore the flowing yet continueth. But when the <hi>moon</hi> ſhall come to the weak Point of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> flowing, ſhe then to the moving of the firſt moveable, is moved by the day quarter of flowing, approaching to the ſtrong Point of flowing, which is above the Horizon: and the <hi>Sun,</hi> becauſe it is diſtant from the <hi>moon</hi> leſs then a quarter, ſhall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be moved by the ſame day quarter of the flowing, and approaching to the weak Point of the <hi>ſouth</hi> reflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:187773:8"/> and therefore becauſe both are moved by the day quarter of flowing, approaching to the ſtrong Point of flowing, which is about the Horizon: And the <hi>ſun,</hi> becauſe it is diſtant from the <hi>moon</hi> leſs then a quarter, ſhall likewiſe be moved by the ſame day quarter of flowing, approaching to the ſame weak Point of the <hi>ſouth</hi> reflowing: and therefore becauſe both are moved by the day quarter of the flowing, the flowing ſhall continue. And when the <hi>ſun</hi> by the moving of the firſt moveable, cometh to the weak Point of the reflowing, becauſe then the <hi>moon</hi> is nearer the ſtrong point of the flowing, which is above the Horizon, then the <hi>ſun</hi> to the ſtrong Point of the reflowing, which is above the Horizon in the day quarter of the reflowing, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall continue.

            <p>And when the <hi>ſun</hi> by the motion of the firſt movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhall come to the ſtrong Point of reflowing, in the

And when the <hi>ſun</hi> ſhall come to the ſtrong Point of the reflowing the <hi>moon</hi> ſhall be departed frem the ſtrong Point of the flowing, in the quarter of the day flowing. And when the <hi>ſun</hi> ſhall come to the ſtrong Point of the reflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>moon</hi> ſhall be departed from the ſtrong Point of the flowing, and therefore the reflowing ſhall continue, And when the <hi>moon</hi> ſhall come to the weak Point of the <hi>South</hi> reflowing, the <hi>ſun</hi> ſhall be departed from the ſtrong Point of the reflowing, in the day quarter of the reflowing, coming towards the weak Point of the <hi>Weſt</hi> flowing: yet ſhall the <hi>ſun</hi> be leſs diſtant from the ſtrong Point of the reflowing, then the <hi>moon</hi> from the ſtrong Point of the flowing, and therefore the reflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall yet continue.

For the ſuperiour bodyes, by their motion and light, give their influence to theſe inferiour bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:187773:17"/> And ſo much more as they have of Light, ſo much more and ſtronger they work: and becauſe in oppoſition of the Moon with the Sun, the moon is full of Light, and her Light is toward us, therefore it is reaſonable that then ſhould be cauſed greater flowings and reflowings, then in her Conjunction with the Sun. Nevertheleſs, becauſe that in her Conjunction with the Sun and Moon are both unite together, and their virtues, therefore alſo are great decreaſings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſings of waters, becauſe both their Virtues are Unite, as I have ſaid, but yet greater is the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition then in the Conjunction, for cauſes before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed.</p>
            <p>The Moon being in her Quadrature with the Sun, the Water of the Sea hath no determinate time of flowing or reflowing, and then are the leſs concourſes of Waters, and leaſt flowing and reflowing. Such motion of the Sea the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as we have ſaid, call it <hi>de fele:</hi> and then the Water of the Sea hath no determinate beginning of flowing or reflowing, but is moved inordinately in a diverſe manner, ſometimes coming, and ſometimes going, the cauſe of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity is, becauſe the Sun and the Moon, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall be in moveing to the water equally, or as it were unequally, have contrariety in whatſoever point they ſhall be: For in whatſoever point the Sun ſhall be, the Moon ſhall be in the point of oppoſite Virtue, contrary to the place of the Sun, or near.</p>
            <p>And when the Moon ſhall be without the ſaid four places, then the Water of the Sea ſhall begin to come or go. And when the Sun and the Moon shall be in equall points of Virtue of the quarters of contrary operation, the concourſes of Waters shall be ſo much the greater, in how much the Moon shall be nearer to her Conjunction with the Sun, or to the Opoſition: and ſo much the leſs in how much the moon shall be nearer to her quadratures, likewiſe the flowings
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:187773:17"/> and the reflowings shall be ſo much the greater, for if the Moon shall be between the Conjunction with the Sun and the firſt Quadrature, then the Moon to the moving of the firſt moveable doth follow the Sun in his riſing, and then shall be the beginning of the day flowing, of the day after the riſing of the Sun, about three of the Clock, or before, that is, when the Moon shall be ſo much above the Horizon on the part of the Eaſt, in the day quarter of flowing, how much the Moon is under the Horiſon on the ſame part of the Eaſt, in the Night quarter of reflowing becauſe then the Sun and Moon shall be of equal force, becauſe they shall be in the points of equal Virtue in the quarters of contrary operation, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Night flowing shall be in the Night, after the ſetting of the Sun (that is) when the Sun shall be ſo much under the Horizon, on the ſame part of the Weſt, in the Day quarter of flowing, how much the Moon is under the Horizon on the ſame part of the Weſt, in the Day quarter of reflowing: and the beginning of the day reflowing shall be in the Day after noon when the Sun shall be ſo mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if the Moon be in the firſt Quadrature and the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, the Moon yet in her riſing followeth the Sun, and then shall be the beginning of the Day following, in the day nfter Noon, about evening (that is) a little before or after, that when the Sun shall be ſo much above the Horizon on the part of the Weſt, in the Day quarter of reflowing, how much the Moon is above the Horizon on the part of the Eaſt, in the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:187773:18"/> Day quarter of flowing, and the beginning of the Night flowing, shall be on the Day before Day (that is) about Morning, before or after (that is) when the Sun ſhall be ſo much under the Horizon on the part of the Eaſt, in the Night quarter of reflowing; how much the Moon is under the Horizon on the part of the Weſt, in the Night quarter of flowing: and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Day reflowing, ſhall be in the Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Noon, when the Sun ſhall be ſo much before the point of Noon, how much the Moon after the point of Midnight, in the quarter of the Night-flowing, how much the Moon is after the point of Noon, or Mid day, in the day quarter of reflowing. And if the Moon ſhall be between the oppſition of the Sun, and her ſecond quadrature with the Sun, then the Moon in her riſing goeth before the Sun, and then the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings both of flowings and reflowings, are in like manner as they were when the Moon was betwen the Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the firſt quadrature. For the beginning of the day flowing ſhall be in the day quarter about three of the Clock, before or after (that is to ſay) when the Sun ſhall be ſo much above the Horizon on the Eaſt part in the day quarter of flowing. And the beginning of the night flowing ſhall be in the Night, when the Sun ſhall be ſo much under the Horizon on the part of the Weſt, in the Night quarter of reflowing, how much the Moon is under the Horizon on the part of the Eaſt, in the night quarter of reflowing: But the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the day reflowing, ſhall be in the day, afternoon, when the Sun shall be ſo much after the point of the South, in the day quarter of reflowing, as the Moon before the point of Midnight, in the Night quarter of flowing. And the beginning of the Night reflowing, shall be in the day, when the Sun shall be ſo much after the point of Midnight, in the Night quarter of reflowing, how much the Moon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the point of Noon, in the day quarter of flowing.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:187773:18"/> And if the Moon ſhall be between the ſecond quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and her conjunction with the Sun, then the Moon alſo in her riſing ſhall go before the Sun: and then ſhall be the beginning of flowing and reflowing, in the ſame hours, as they be when the Moon is in the firſt quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and oppoſition: becauſe the beginning of the day of the day flowing, in the day after noon about even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before or after, when the Sun ſhall be ſo much above the Horizon on the part of the Weſt, in the day quarter of reflowing, how much the Moon is under the Horizon on the ſame part of the Weſt, in the night quarter of flowing: and the beginning of the night flowing ſhall be in the night, about morning, before or after, when the Sun ſhall be ſo much under the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon on the part of the Eaſt, in the night quarter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing, how much the Moon is above the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rizon in the ſame part of the Eaſt, in the day quarter of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But the beginning of the day flowing, ſhall be on the day before noon, when the Moon ſhall be ſo much after the point of midday, or the South, in the day quarter of reflowing, how much the Sun is before it in the day quarter of flowing, and the beginning of the night reflowing, ſhall be in the night before midnight: that is, when the Moon ſhall be ſo much after the point of midnight, in the night quarter of reflowing, how much the Sun before the point of midnight, is in the night quarter of flowing. And hereby it appeareth, that as well the flowing as the reflowing of the Water of the Sea, begin (as we have ſaid) not always in the ſame hours of the night, for the beginning of flowing is either in the beginning of the day, or the beginning of the night, which chanceth, the Moon being in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or oppoſition to the Sun, or is before day, from the mornings towards the day, or from the day, untill four of the Clock, or thereabouts; or is before even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, towards the evening Tyde, and from thence to the Cock Crowing, or thereabouts: which chanceth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:187773:19"/> when the Moon is between her conjunction or oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Sun, or any of the quadratures. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of the reflowing is either at noon, or at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, as when the Moon is in conjunction or oppoſition with the Sun, or is before noon, or after, or before midnight, or after, as when the Moon is between her conjunction or oppoſition with the Sun, and any of her quadratures. It is apparent alſo, that ſometimes the Water of the Sea doth not determinate or certain begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither order of flowing or reflowing, which chanceth, the Moon being in her quadratures with the Sun. It is manifeſt alſo, that all flowing of the Water of the Sea, is cauſed by reſpect to the Horizon, on the part of the Eaſt or Weſt. And every reflowing by the reſpect to the meridian, or to the point of midday, or midnight. Here alſo is to be conſidered, that all that is ſaid, are moſt certainly true in a right Horizon, but in an oblique or ſide Horizon, they ſometimes faile, as ſhall be ſaid hereafter following.</p>
            <p>It happeneth (as I have ſaid) that the Water of the Sea doth ſometimes wander or decline from the order already preſcribed, yet commonly, and for the moſt part keepeth the due order. Such manner of declining is after two ſorts, for there is either diſorder or error in the hour of the begining of the motion of the flowing or reflowing, or in the middeſt of the motion: (that is) that they have greater or leſſer courſes then at other times, or otherwiſe greater or leſſer increaſes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes: the errour coming in the hour of motion, may proceed from the cauſes; as by reaſon of the ſituation of the Region, or by reaſon of the Bodies ſuperceleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or by change of the Air.</p>
            <p>By reaſon of ſituation of Regions, chanceth diverſity only in the hour of the begining of the flowing, becauſe the begining thereof hath reſpect to the Horizon, or is by reſpect to the Horizon: for in the begining of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing is no diverſity or errour, becauſe the begining
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:187773:19"/> of the reflowing, is by reſpect to the Meridian Circle. Again, by reaſon of the ſituation of the Region, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity happeneth thus, that is, that either the Region is under the Equinoctial Circle, or without it. And if it be under the Circle, becauſe they have a right Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and the days there are always equal with nights, at all times of the year.</p>
            <p>That we have ſaid of divers hours of the begining of flowing is certainly true: But Regions diſtant from the Equinoctial, becauſe they have a winding or ſlope Horizon, in them the beginings of flowings are, as in Regions under the Equinoctial, only in two times of the year: that is to ſay, in the Spring time, or Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial Vernal, and in the time of <hi>Autumne,</hi> or Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial <hi>Autumnal,</hi> that is to ſay, about the middeſt of the Month of <hi>March,</hi> and about the middeſt of the Month of <hi>September:</hi> But in other times of the year, or from the <hi>Vernal</hi> Equinoctial, by the whole Summer, until the Equinoctial <hi>Autumnal,</hi> it is otherwiſe, becauſe the begining of the day flowing, if the flowing be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noon, that is, about the morning, or ſhall be later then it ought to be: that is to ſay, more of the day then is in Regions under the Equinoctial, and that is, becauſe that in ſuch Regions the day begineth ſooner, or the Sun riſeth ſooner, then in the Regions which are under the Equinoctial: for the declining of the obliqe or ſide Horizon (although theſe Regions be under one and the ſame Meridian) and if the begining of the day flowing be after noon, that is about evening, then ſuch begining ſhall be ſooner then it is in Regions under the Equinoctial (that is to ſay) in fewer hours of the day, becauſe that then the Sun faleth later then in Regions which be under the Equinoctial; but the begining of the night flowing, if it be before midnight, it is ſooner in the ſaid places or Regions (that is to ſay) in leſs time of the Night, or in leſs time after the ſetting of the Sun, then in the Regions under the Equinoctial: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:187773:20"/> that then the night begineth to them afterwards. And if the begining of the night flowing be after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night (that is) towards the day, it ſhall be later (that is) of more hours, or more near the day, then is in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions under the Equinoctial, becauſe the Sun riſeth ſooner to them, then to thoſe that are under the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial. And this diverſity groweth ſo much, that ſometimes it chanceth to ſee two flowings in one day, and none in the night: which happeneth from the inequality of the days, with their nights. For in how much the Artificial day ſhall be longer then his night, ſo much diverſity and errour ariſeth more evidently. Therefore in the longeſt days of the year, ſuch diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall appear manifeſtly. But from the Equinoctial <hi>Autumnal,</hi> by all Winter, untill the Equinoctial <hi>Vernal,</hi> it is contrary: becauſe the begining of the day flowing, if it be before noon (that is) about the morning, then ſhall it be ſooner then it ſhould be (that is to ſay) in fewer hours of the day, then it ſhould be in a right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon: for then the day begineth later, or the Sun riſeth later to them that have a winding or crooked Horizon. And if ſuch flowing ſhall be after noon (that is) about evening, then the begining of ſuch flowing ſhall be latelyer (that is) more towards the evening, or nearer to the ſetting of the Sun, then in Regions which are under the Horizon; for in a ſide or crooked Horizon the night is ſooner, and the Sun falleth ſooner then in a right Horizon. Alſo, the begining of the night flowing, if it ſhall be before midnight, it ſhall be later and more in the night, then in Regions under the Equinoctial; becauſe then the night ſhall ſooner begin in the crooked Horizon then in the right, becauſe the Sun firſt falleth in the crooked Horizon, then in the right. And if the begining of the night flowing ſhall be after midnight, that is, towards the day, then ſuch begining of flowing in the crooked Horizon ſhall be ſooner, (that is) more before the day, or before the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:187773:20"/> riſing of the Sun, then ſhall be in Regions which are under the Equinoctial. And ſuch diverſity groweth ſo much, that ſometimes ſhall be two flowings in the night, and none in the day. And this chanceth from the inequality and increaſe of the night above his day, for in how much the night ſhall be longer then his day, ſo much the more groweth ſuch diverſity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch diverſity ſhall appear greateſt in the longeſt night of the year; wherefore by the aforeſaid, it is manifeſt, that how much the nearer we ſhall be to the Equinoctial, ſo much the leſs ſhall appear the diverſity in the hour of the begining of the flowing of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And how much the Sun ſhall be nearer to the ſtandings or ſtayings of the Sun (called <hi>Solititium</hi>) or the longeſt days, and longeſt nights, ſo much greater and more certain ſhall be the diverſity, and ſhall appear more manifeſtly. Furthermore, diverſity happeneth by reaſon of the Heavenly Bodies, and Errour, not only in the begining of flowing, but alſo of reflowing.</p>
            <p>For when any of the great and Luminous Stars (as are <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi>) ſhall be above the Sun or Moon, they help them in moving of the Water of the Sea: and therefore by this means alſo, they leave their due order. Likewiſe (as we have ſaid) by reaſon of the change of the Air, oftentimes chanceth diverſity and errour in the beginings of flowing and reflowing: for the violent diſpoſition of Winds vehemently blowing, as well near as far off, removeth the Courſes of Water from their due order, ſomtimes haſtening the flowing, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the reflowing, and ſomtimes ſtaying and ſlacking them likewiſe.</p>
            <p>There chanceth alſo, errour in the midſt of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Waters; for as well courſes of Waters, as alſo flowings and reflowings, ſomtimes keep not the due motion. For (as it is ſaid) the diſpoſition of Winds may either increaſe or diminiſh their Courſes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the ſtraitneſs and narrowneſs of places, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:187773:21"/> of the Iſlands and Mountains, cauſe great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and Diverſities in many places. For when the Sea is ſtraiter or narrower, there is the ſtrongeſt courſe, as about the Iſland <hi>Euboes, Nigropontis,</hi> and between <hi>Cicilia</hi> and <hi>Calabria</hi> is greatly obſerved. Such ſtraits hinder the increaſe of Waters, becauſe leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity paſſeth thereby, and therefore there the flowings &amp; reflowings are leſs. And hereupon it happeneth, that in the Ocean Sea are greateſt flowings and reflowings, becauſe there are no ſtraits which may hinder or ſtay the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Waters; and by that means they have their full and free courſe, and in more certain order: But in the <hi>Mare Mediteraneum</hi> it is otherwiſe, for whatſoever Water of the Ocean entreth therein, or cometh forth, paſſeth from the Weſt by one only narrow ſtrait; and therefore it cannot in the flowing be greatly filled, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the reflowing be greatly emptyed. And ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the motion of the motion of the Sea proceedeth not in certain order.</p>

               <p>This ſtone is known by colour, virtue, weight and equality, the beſt colour is ſaid to be like pure Iron, ſhining, mixed with Indian or Heavenly colour, and is in a manner like Iron Poliſhed.

By equality it is judged, if it be alike in one ſubſtance and colour: but if it be unequal with chapes (as we ſhall hereafter expreſs) together with hollow places indented, having red ſpots here and there, it is unapt not ſo fit for the Art of Navigation, or of continual Motion. It repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth the ſimilitude of Heaven, for like as in Heaven there are two points immoveable, ending in the Axle-tree of the Sphere, upon which the whole Frame of Heaven is turned (as may be experienced by the Art that Chriſtal and other ſtones are Poliſhed) even ſo the Load-ſtone reduced into a Globious or round Form, laying thereon a Needle or any other like Iron, then which way ſoever the Needle turneth and reſteth, thereby is ſhewed the place of the Poles; and that this may be done more certainly, it muſt be often times at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, and the Line ſhewed by the Needle, muſt be obſerved, for ſuch Lines ſhall cut the one, the other in two Points, as the <hi>Meridian</hi> Circles joyn together

Some ignorant Men were of opinion, that the Vertue of the Load-ſtone was not derived from Heaven, but rather of the nature of the place where it is engendred, ſaying that the Mines thereof are found in the North, and that therefore ever one part of the ſtone extendeth towards the North. But they ſurely are ignorant that this ſtone is found in other places whereof it ſhould as well follow that it ſhould extend it ſelf to other and divers parts, as to the North; which

Neither is it to be believed, that the North-Star of the Marriners is the Pole: For as much as that Star is without the Meridian Line, and but twice within one revolution of the Firmament. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Marvelous Vertue of this Stone dependeth of Heaven, who would believe that only two points thereof ſhould ſo turn themſelves, and that rather every part of it ſhould not incline to ſome like part in Heaven, as may thus be proved. Let the Stone be brought into a Spherical round forme, as is ſaid, and the Poles being found, let it be turned upon two pins, or Turners inſtruments, and there be pullyſhed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be on every part of equall heavineſs, which you may well find by often proving: For that part that falleth down is heavieſt, which done, frame in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian Circle with the Horizon, wherein faſten two other pins on which it may eaſily move, and divide the Poles moſt exactly to the Poles of the World, the which if it come well to paſs, rejoyce that then you have found one of the greateſt Miracles of Natural things. For you ſhall by this means ſee the Aſcendent, the place of the Sun, and the like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at every Moment. But if it fall not out according to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, you ought not to impute that to the Art, but to your own ignorance and negligence, For if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute and perform all things duly and aright accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Art, you need not to doubt the ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>How theſe Inſtruments by this Stone may be framed, by the which may be found the <hi>Azimuths</hi> of the Sun and Star (that is to ſay, Verticall Circles) it ſhall not here be neceſſary to ſhew, foraſmuch as the ſame is eaſily done by the Marriners Compaſs, or by the Box with the <hi>Magnes</hi> or Load-ſtone incloſed, and floating above the Water, with a pin erected, and in the uppermoſt part divided into 360 parts, after the manner of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.</p>

               <p>That you may eaſily find out the chief points of any Load-ſtone of what forme ſoever, you muſt make a reſpective or declinatory Needle, of an Inch or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts in length, and giving him his touch, faſten him by the <hi>Axis</hi> upon a little forked ſtick, or any thing like it, that the Needle may have free ſcope, then offer the Stone (as we ſaid before) near the Needle, turning of it round about, and immediatly you ſhall ſee the North of the Needle (as it is as yet common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, becauſe it pointeth toward the North) point directly unto the true North end of the Stone as ſoon as it commeth near unto it, and as you turn away the end of the Stone, the Needle will point ſomewhat towards it, till the South end of the Stone approacheth (as we have in part declared) for then will the Needle wheele about the <hi>Axis,</hi> and point directly with his South, and to the South ef the Stone. But if you hold the Needle near to the Stone, in ſuch ſort that it cannot turn about at liberty, then the force of the Stone may ſoon change the properties of the ends of the Needle, that the one point which was North ſhall become South, and that other which was South ſhall become North, yet the thing it ſelf is eaſily diſcerned: for the Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end will alwayes hang lower.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>And whereſoever the Needle, being held nearer to the ſtone, doth ſtand parrallell unto it, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineing with either end towards the ſtone, there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, under the middle of the Needle, the North and the South properties of the ſtone do divide and part themſelves. This matter is much better perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſmall narrow Load-ſtone of half an Inch (more or leſs) in length, haveing in the ends his due points of North and South and wrought over with ſilk of two colours from the middle to each end; as for Example, Yellow and White; that part which point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over to the North let it, be wrought over with White, and the other with Yellow. Then if you hang that in the middle by a fine ſilk thred, and apply it to any other Load-ſtone, the South end of the one will readily find out the North end of the other; and contrarywiſe, In like manner, with this Magnetical Inſtrument you may ſee two pretty concluſions. The one if you touch a knife with the end of a forceable Load-ſtone, whether it be North or South, and hang this wrought on by a ſilke thred in the middle, that it may hang freely, the one end will crave towards the point of the knife, and the other will not abide it. The
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:187773:34"/> other is, if you hang it end long, with the true North end, right over the North end of a forcible Load-ſtone, or with the South end over the South end of the other, you ſhall ſee that it will in no wiſe (being let down) come unto the North point of the Load-ſtone, but will (contrary to Phyloſophycal Principles, that heavy things ſhould tend directly downwards) by the means of the Silk Thread, ſwim or wheele the end of the Load-ſtone in the Air: yea, and lift it ſelf ſomewhat upwards, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then perpendicularly light down upon it; yea, that it will doe although you place a Plate of Silver or Braſs, or any ſuch thing, between the ſtone and it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way is to take a Thread of a common Sowing Needle, and touch the point of it with the North end of a Load-ſtone whoſe points you would find out, holding the Needle about an Inch from it, and in turning the ſtone about, you ſhall preſently ſee the Needle point to the North end, when by your turning it cometh near. The contrary effect enſueth, if you touch the point of the Needle with the other end of the ſtone, wherein you may behold that ancient conceived, and of late years maintained opinion of the contrariety of the Load-ſtone and the Theamedes to be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then a contrary property of one and the ſelf ſame Magnes.</p>
               <p>The third way, is to breake off the point of a Sowing Needle half an Inch or longer (if the ſtone be good) but not above a quarter of an Inch (if it be a baſe ſtone) lay it upon the ſtone, and move it to and fro upon the ſuperficies thereof (being ſmooth) with the Needles point forwards, and as it cometh near any of the two points of force, it will raiſe it ſelf more and more: but being brought unto the point it ſelf, it will ſtand there ſtrait upright; if the ſtone be ragged, this cannot be practiced, otherwiſe of all other it is the moſt certain way. Now whether it be your North or South end the effect will ſoon declare.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:187773:34"/>
               <p>The fourth way is, that you having an ordinary Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or a Sailing Compaſs, or any Magnetical Needle ſtanding on a ſharp point, hold near thereunto the ſtone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ning it in your hand, then will the North end of the Needle (I mean the end that pointeth to the North) reſpect the true North point of the ſtone.</p>
               <p>The fifth way is alſo, if you touch a common ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing Needle (the longer the better) and put it through a little piece of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

And here it is to be remembred, that none other way whatſoever will more readily or truely define the Magnetical <hi>Meridian.</hi> And therefore as it is very requiſite for many purpoſes, that every Traveller by Land, but more eſpecially by Sea, ſhould always have (if he may) an aequinoctial Dyal with him, ſo would I not with that any of them ſhould be without ſome Sowing Needles, touched with a good ſtone, which will both ſerve the proper uſes of Sowing without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing their touch (for it is open Air and Ruſt that are the greateſt Enemies thereof) and at any time with a piece of Cork or a dry Stick in the Water the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>Meridian</hi> may be ſeen; a matter though mean and trivial in ſhew, yet between whiles of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that it may ſerve to ſave many mens lives.</p>
               <p>A ſixt way is alſo, if you prepare a little round Load-ſtone of a quarter of an Inch <hi>Diameter</hi> or thereabouts (but it muſt be a very good one) having his Poles mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſitted in ſuch manner, that it eaſily turn about in a little Frame according to the following Picture.

               <p>Then by moving it in his Frame all over the ſtone the North Pole of this will find the South of the other and likewiſe will the South, the North of the great one; for it is not in outward ſhew one Magnet and another, as is between a Magnet and a Magnetical Needle, the contrary ends of the Magnet will covet in their motion to meet together, but the end of the Needle which turneth North, will come unto the North of the ſtone: For in very truth it is the South point of the Needle, even as the Magnet it ſelf being placed in a Wooden Diſh in Water, will turn with his North end to the South, and with his South end Diſh and all, towards the North. The like effect will alſo follow if you hang as aforeſaid a ſmall Load-ſtone in the middle of a ſmall Silk Thread, and that it may freely turn without impediment, according to its nature; but this property it will ſhew quicker or flower, according unto the goodneſs of the ſubſtance and fitneſs of the form.

               <p>For as much then as all Magnets themſelve, and all Magnetical Bodies (being ſo placed as that they have their free motion) compoſe themſelves Magnetically towards the Poles of the Earth, it muſt needs be that it is the true natural South end of the Magnet or Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Needle, that pointeth towards the North of the Earth: And it is the true natural North end of the Magnet or Magnetical Needle that ponteth towards the South of the Earth, becauſe the contrary ends do affect one another, and each of them do naturally fly, the one end of the one, from the end of the other, which is of like denomination unto it ſelf: for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in this following Diagram of the whole Magnet, <hi>E A.</hi> is ſuppoſed to note the true natural North end thereof, and <hi>B.</hi> the South end.</p>

               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:187773:42"/>
               <p>The cauſe thereof is, when a Load-ſtone with his double cap is placed upon <hi>A,</hi> the force of both ends ſtriving in that piece of Iron paralellwiſe unto the Axis of the ſtone, the North and South forces are driven more cloſely unto their proper ends. But <hi>B.</hi> (becauſe of the immediate Copper) there cannot be no ſuch cloſe dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his forces unto their proper ends, as was in <hi>A:</hi> and therefore the Load-ſtone lifteth up <hi>B.</hi> but only as if his two ends were two little looſe pieces of Iron, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Air, and the intermediate Copper a burthen upon them. But by placing <hi>B.</hi> upon <hi>A, A.</hi> in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (as it were) of a Bridge, joyneth the two ends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in their former combats, and the two ends of <hi>B.</hi> foraſmuch as they are, but (as it were) two looſe pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Iron hanging in the Air, the two forces of the Load-ſtone North and South, diſtinctly and ſeverally paſs thorough them downwards into <hi>A,</hi> which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>When a Load-ſtone lifteth up Iron at one end only, the virtue of a ſtone is infuſed into the whole body downward of that Iron, if it be not very long.</p>
               <p>But when by means of the double caps, both ends do lift Iron joyntly together, he infuſeth very ſmall force downwards into the body of the Iron that it lifteth up: for the forces of both ends are ſo ſtriving in the Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Line of the Iron, paralell to the Axis of the ſtone, that whereas a good Magnet lifting up at one end, will entend his virtue downwards twelve or fourteen Inches, in applying both ends unto the Iron, by the means of the double caps, he will not extend his force downwards the diſtance of one Inch, nor with any ſtrength the diſtance of half an Inch, as in this former Example.</p>

                  <hi>Pliny</hi> in his natural Hiſtory writeth, that <hi>Dinocrates</hi> that Famous Architect Builder of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> at <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> command began to vault a Temple with Magnets, that there might ſeem to hang in the Air the Image of his Siſter <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> made of Iron for that purpoſe: but both <hi>Dinocrates</hi> and <hi>Ptolomie</hi> dying in the mean ſpace, that enterpriſe ceaſed. Neither indeed (if the both had lived) could it ever have come to paſs by that means, by reaſon of two impoſſibilities: the one is, that by the force of the Load-ſtones, nothing can ſo hang in the Air, but that it either muſt touch the ſtone it ſelf, or ſome other intermediate ſubſtance between it and the ſtone, that bareth it from coming to the ſtone it ſelf. For Example, lay two or three Needles upon a ſmooth Table, put a Silver or Pewter Plate upon them, and upon that Plate a Load-ſtone, then lift up the Plate aloft with the Load-ſtone lying ſtill upon it, and you ſhall ſee the Needles hanging indeed in the Air end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and if you move the ſtone about the Plate, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſtill underneath, but evermore touching the Plate, which is the intermediate body, which keepeth them from coming to touch the ſtone, which otherwiſe by their natural inclination very ſpeedily they would do. But as for the Image of <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> how had it been poſſible for it to have toucht at once, mediately or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, ſo great a number of Load-ſtones, whereof the pretended Vault muſt needs have conſiſted? the other is, that ſuch a multitude of Magnets would no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confound the one the others forces, ſo that one of them alone being ſolitary and ſevered from his company, might ſhew more force than all the inſociable ſociety could do each one hindering the efficacie of the other. Much like a Team of many Horſes, where every one drawing his ſeveral way, might ſoon with diſordered ſtretching tire himſelf and his fellows, but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:187773:43"/> never move the Load one jote from the place. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as one (and poſſibly the worſt) would do more good alone, where he might orderly and freely uſe his own ſtrength, then he and all the many of them could do, being joyned together in vicinitie of bodies, but extreamly diſtracted through contrarity of courſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</p>
               <p>The only way to perform ſuch a deſign (if it were worth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he doing) would be to prepare one mighty great Load-ſtone of excellent goodneſs, which having his due proportion, after an extended Ovall form, ſhould be fitted with double caps, and ſo placed in the Roof of a Building, that his Axis be paralell to the Horizon: in this manner (out of all doubt) a fair large Image might be held up very ſtrongly by ſuch a Magnet, let the ſtuff or ſubſtance thereof be whatſoever (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the lighter the better) ſo that there be faſtened to the uppermoſt part of the Image a ſmall piece of Iron, according prepared and placed for the two promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ends of the double caps of the ſtone, to lay hold thereon. But enough hereof.</p>
               <p>In the caping of the Magnets, this general rule is to be obſerved, that they ought to be made of the fineſt and ſofteſt Iron, and not of Steel: the weight alſo, which the Magnet taketh up, ſhould be of the like Iron, and not of Steel (as aforeſaid) for although Steel at the leaſt retaineth Ten times as much virtue as Iron, when it is once ſeperated from the ſtone, can doe; yet as long as there is any contignity between the ſtone and them, he holdeth Iron more ſtronger than Steel. Both which differences in either of them, by manifeſt experience are certain, and ſeem to proceed from nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faſtneſs and cloſeneſs in the Steel above the Iron; by means whereof the Magnetical Virtue doth longer and more forcibly continue in that than this: even as fire more mightily poſſeſſeth, and for a greater ſpace abideth in ſtone, or any ſuch firm or ſolid matter, then
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:187773:44"/> in Wood or Straw, or the like thin and hollow ſubſtance; and therefore thoſe Compaſs makers, that make the Wiers of their Flies for Sailing Compaſſes of meer Iron, ought not by any means to be ſuffered; for to gain Two-pence in a Compas (and ſcarcely that) they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerably abuſe thoſe that Travel by Sea, to their great danger and miſchief.</p>
               <p>To cement and piece Load-ſtones, for your Simmon doe thus: take the fine powder of Load-ſtone, half ſo much powder of New-brick made very ſmall and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, one part of Burgundy-pitch, half ſo much of Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, a ſmall portion of unwrought Wax: mingle all theſe together very well upon a ſoft Fire, and make the whole Maſs in little Roules. Now when you will ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a ſtone, do thus: heat the two pieces of the ſtone very hot, and likewiſe the Simmon, then ſtrake the places as you will ſoder, over with the Simmon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thinly, and joyn them ſomewhat hard together, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them ſo ſtand untill they be cold, and you ſhall have it fully as ſtrong, as if it were an intire ſtone it ſelf, and not to be ſevered by great heat of Fire. In piecing of the Load-ſtones, there muſt be great care taken to the nature of the Load-ſtone in general, and alſo to thoſe particular pieces which you would joyn together. The Load-ſtone in general (as it is ſhewed before) that his force iſſueth (as it were) from a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the middle of the ſtone, to all the ſuperficies whereof univerſally, but moſt ſtrongly unto the Poles from the middle, one way the ſtone is all of a Northly nature, and all of it Southly the other way.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like as exact agreement is between two Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Figures, when being applyed together, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of the one, do preciſely fall upon the extreams of the other, each upon his correſpondent extream, and it is made one therewith: even ſuch is the perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or ſetting together the parts of a Magnetical Body, and namely of thoſe two equal parts before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifyed, you muſt ſo joyn one upon another, that the two extreams or ends be always of the ſame nature Northly or Southly, in both parts; and that by the due application of the parts, the two Northly ends being united and become one, as alſo the two Southly after the ſame manner. But if theſe parts, being of equal
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:187773:47"/> length, be joyned longwiſe, the North of the one unto the South of the other; thoſe two ends that were (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now no ends, but the juſt middle of one Magnet) have loſt their properties which they had when they were ends. For thoſe properties, by this Union are aboliſhed, but their other ends ſtill reſerve their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and ſtronger virtues of North and South; and ſo according to Magnetical nature, one Magnet ſhall have but two Poles, the North and the South. Again, if you will piece two Load-ſtones together in thickneſs, the one of them being longer than the other; then you muſt either cut the longer that it may be fit in length unto the ſhorter, or elſe piece the ſhorter in ſuch a manner as is before deſcribed, that he be equal in length to the longer, and whatſoever diſorderly parts perhaps ſhall be in any of them, they may, even after they are cemented, very well be ground away. Alſo if there be holes or dents, with little pieces of Load-ſtones ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented (their points being obſerved) they may be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up, without any manner of damage or deformity, no more then if there had not been any ſuch at all. And after this Method you may (with labour and induſtry) of many Magnets, make one huge, and of what form you pleaſe. And although the Magnets of this body, Magnetically compact (as I have here ſhewed) were never ſo many in number, yet the whole will have but two principal points, the one the North, the other the South, even as if it were one natural Load-ſtone, and all of them will contribute their forces unto theſe two points; ſo that if there were twenty of them, being after this order cemented together into one body, the whole would have but two points, but if you will place them in a Vault, according to a Maſons Trade, they will have 40 points, twenty North, and as many South, and will work the like effect in drawing Iron, as (to uſe the former groſs ſimilitude) if a Teeme of Horſes were ſet in their Traces contrary the one to the other,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:187773:47"/> the one to pull one way and the other anorher. As for the Turks Mahomet, hanging in the Air with his Iron Cheſt, it is a moſt groſs untruth, and utterly impoſſible it is for any thing to hang ſo in the Air by any Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power, but that either it muſt touch the ſtone it ſelf, or elſe (as we have ſaid) ſome intermediate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that hindereth it from coming to the ſtone, or elſe ſome ſtay below to keep it from aſcending, as ſome ſmall Wyer that can ſcarcely be ſeen or perceived.</p>

Certain it is that this piece of Earth thus ordered, will ſenſibly ſhew you that it hath true Magnetical Virtue. But here before I proceed any farther, I muſt deliver unto you a neceſſary obſervation: There are two ſorts of Attractions (as they are commonly called) the one Magnetical, the other Electrical. The Magnetical hath always a ſpecial reſpect to the North and South
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:187773:48"/> points (as we have often ſaid) of the Magnet or Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Body. The Electrical Body hath no manner of reſpect to any one point of the Electrical Body, more than another: and by this difference theſe two kinds of Attractions are eaſily diſcerned: as alſo by this look what end of the Magnetical Needle the one end of the Magnet doth draw, the other will chaſe away; but the Electrical Body draweth alike at all ends. And Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after this manner, lap this Electrical Body in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and it will draw nothing to it at all, but interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Braſs or a ſtone Wall within the Orbe of the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets virtue, doth nothing weaken the ſame, or hinder his effect towards his peculiar object. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (to ſpeak properly) Attraction appertaineth only to Electrical Bodies, becauſe the whole Attractive vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is only in the Electrical Body it ſelf, and nothing as in the thing that is attracted. The Attraction (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo called) of the Load-ſtone is rightly to be termed, <hi>Concurſion, Confluence,</hi> or <hi>Coition,</hi> becauſe it is the running or vigorous meeting together of two Magnetical Bodies, having a mutual Inclination the one with the other, or by any other name, bearing the like ſenſe. For the true knowledge thereof, being but lately as a ſtranger arrived amongſt us, for common uſe.</p>
               <p>(<hi>Quem penes arbitrium eſt, et jus et Norma Loquendi,</hi> hath as yet ſcant ſuited it, with a convenient Name to expreſs this property; ſo that Magnetical concluſion is never but between two Bodies, ſuch as both of them are Magnetical; as of one Load-ſtone with another, or of a Load-ſtone with Iron or Steel, or Iron Oare if it be prepared, or between two pieces of Iron or Steel thac are Revived with a Load-ſtone; for indeed the Load-ſtone can but revive and multiply Magnetical force in a Body that naturally hath it in ſome meaſure before: but cannot infuſe it into any thing, that before is utterly void of it, as of Mettalls in Iron and Steel, and not in Gold, Silver, Braſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>But that above mentioned piece of Earth, prepared in ſuch a manner as is before preſcribed, will by Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Concurſion ſhew it ſelf to be a true Magnetical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For the one end of the Magnetical Needle will covet towards the one of the prepared Maſs, and flye from the other. And contrarywiſe alſo, though it will do both but weakly, not with power comparable to a natural Load-ſtone, yet as truly as that. That end which cooled towards the South, will draw the true North end of the Needle, and that end which cooled towards the North will draw the true South end of the Needle. If ſo be that as yet you will have another in fallible Argument, do thus; mark what end draweth the North end of the Needle, afterwards put the new made Magnet into the fire again, and when it hath been glowing for the ſpace of half a quarter of an hour, take it out and cool it, being placed with that marked towards the North, moſt aſſuredly that end now will draw the South end of the Needle, and the North end of the Needle will ſhun it, which before approached unto it, the reaſon hereof is, becauſe the firſt having aboliſhed all the former. Magnetical quality of that Maſs wherewith it was in a contrary poſition affected in the former cooling, now leaving it apt and fit to receive any new Impreſſion: which preſently it taketh again either regularly, if in the cooling it be placed with the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:187773:49"/> ends to the North and South, or (if it be placed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) confuſedly, by the Magnetical force and virtue of the whole body of the Earth by regular and confuſed, this is the meaning. Take any lump of Earth, or any Brick-bat ordered in this manner, certain it is that this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ump of Earth or Brick-bat hath ſome Magnetical vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue therein, yet ſo feeble and weak, that our ſence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern it, becauſe of the unfitneſs of the form, and the confuſed diſperſion of that weak force, through the whole body thereof. Then ſuppoſe you will bring ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe into an extended Ovall form, which is apt (as before I have ſaid) for any body Magnetical to ſhew his force, yet this will help it nothing at all of it ſelf, as you may eaſily make experience in every Load-ſtone. For if you take a Load-ſtone of a confuſed form, it is not enough to bring it into a convenient Ovall, except with diligence you reſerve the points of the North and South in the two ends thereof, for if you leave the points in the ſides, you ſpoile it with this Ovall form. For the ſtone will not lightly be of one quarter of the force, as it was before; for the Ovall form giveth it no virtue, but it is the fitteſt for it to ſhew the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of that ſtrength, which of it ſelf it had before, if you obſerve the due points, and not otherwiſe. But in this Earth and Brick it is not poſſible to find the due points in ſuch a manner as you may in a Load-ſtone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the weakneſs of the Magnetical force therein contained. And therefore you cannot bring that into a regular Ovall form, and by the Fire take away the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Magnetical force, and all other perverſe qualities thereof, that being by nature a Magnetical body in his cooling before ſpecified, receiving preſently by that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable power of the Earth, his Magnetical virtue, according unto that form, and will regularly have his due points preciſely in the ends, without any confuſion. <hi>Johannes Babtista Porta</hi> writes, that he did make tryal of the way that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> hath ſet down for to increaſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:187773:50"/> the virtue of a Magnet; Namely, to heat him red hot in the Fire, and to quench him in the Oyl of <hi>Crocus Martis:</hi> and <hi>Babtiſta Porta</hi> ſaith, that he found it a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable falſehood. But ſaith he, he is ſo far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing his virtue, as that (being once red hot) he looſeth all his own, paſt all recovery. But for all this that he ſaith, I doubt whether <hi>Paracelſus</hi> be juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved or not, for by my own experience I know that the heating of a Load-ſtone untill it be red hot, doth weaken a Load-ſtone, but taketh not away all its force; and in my tryal hereof, I found a very manifeſt proof of the Magnetiſme of the Earth, which I thought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to inſert in this place. I have made this tryal of fragments of Magnets in divers kinds, and likewiſe of divers kinds of Iron Mines which are next in degree to the Magnets; Namely, after this manner, Heat him in the Fire by little and little (for fear of breaking) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he be red hot, then take him out and let him cool, then mark (with Chalk or what you pleaſe) thoſe parts that reſpect the North and South, and you ſhall find thoſe markt places, the North and the South Poles of the Magnet. Put him into the fire again, untill he be red hot, and cool him contrarily, and you ſhall have the contrary effect. Therefore if <hi>Babtſta Porta</hi> did make his tryal with a Load-ſtone very long in form, and chanced (for Doctor <hi>Gilberts</hi> miſtery of the Magnetiſme was not then revealed) for to cool him in his Oyl of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> with his ends Eaſt and Weſt, the Axis of the ſtone being then overthwart in the middle, it were no marvel, though it found no force in the ends. And I doe not think it impoſſible, but that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> way may doe ſome good rightly uſed. Doctor <hi>Gilbert</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that ſome Iron Mine will affect a Magnetical Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, as it is of it ſelf, being unprepared by fire: but as yet I never could find any ſuch, but this I have often tryed, that it being of no manner of Magnetical virtue of it ſelf, no more then a Flint ſtone unprepared by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:187773:50"/> fire, being made red hot and cooled, is preſently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with very apparent Magnetical virtue, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſcituation that he is cooled in, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you heat and cool him often, and divers ways, he will ſtill keep his virtues, according to the ſituation of his cooling. And ſome Iron Mines I have found, which being but in this ſort prepared, have had as ſtrong force as ſome natural Magnets have had; it is the goodneſs of the Load-ſtone joyned with a fit form that will ſhew great force: For as a very good form with a baſe ſubſtance can doe but very little, ſo the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Load-ſtone be it never ſo excellent, except it have ſome convenient form, is not availeable. For example, an excellent Load-ſtone of a pound weight and of a good faſhion, being uſed artificially, may take up four pounds of Iron; beat it into ſmall powder, and it ſhall be of no force to take up one ounce of Iron; yea I am very well aſſured, that half an ounce of a Load-ſtone of good faſhion, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of like virtue, will take up more then a pound will doe being beaten in powder. Whence (to add to this by the way) it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth manifeſtly, that it is a great errour of thoſe Phyſitians and Chirurgeons, which to remedy Ruptures, doe preſcribe unto their Patients to take the powder of Load-ſtone inwardly, and the ſmall filling of Iron in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly: ſuppoſe here that the Magnetical drawing ſhould do great wonders, whereas they conſider not that the ſtone being diſſolved into powder, every little particle of the duſt hath two points contrary, the one drawing to, the other repelling and putting from; and ſo being thus confounded by a contrary working, doth much more harm then good with his Magnetical quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As for the aſtringent and drying property of the Load-ſtone, I leave them to the diligent obſervation of thoſe that are ſkilful in Phyſick: but to return to our purpoſe, and to alledge this alſo, beſides the manifeſt proof, if the Earth were not by Nature a Magnetical
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:187773:51"/> body, the aforeſaid mentioned piece of Earth were not by Nature a Magnetical body, the afore mentioned piece of Earth could not receive from a Load-ſtone any Magnetical power: but moſt certain it is, and by many undoubted experiments confired, that it will evidently receive a Magnetical power from a Load-ſtone: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is manifeſt that the Earth is by nature a Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical power: but moſt certain it is, and by many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted experiments confirmed, that it will evidently receive Magnetical power from a Load-ſtone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is manifeſt that the Earth is by nature a Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body. Farthermore, as amongſt all the Mettalls, Iron doth imcomparably more reſemble the Earth in ſubſtance then any other doth; it likewiſe doth partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate more with the Earth in quality, and principally in the Magnetical peculiar property hereof, as notorious experience declareth; yea every piece of Iron Oare, being naturally (as Doctor <hi>Gilbert</hi> ſheweth) a Magnet, although of feeble force, and all Magnets being a kind of an Iron Oare, is the very cauſe, that only Iron or Steel, and no other Mettall is capable of that virtue, Namely, to have that revived and multiplyed by the vicinity of a Magnet, which at the firſt in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was originally in it ſelf, as it is aforeſaid; it is alſo well known, that the Magnet is a ſtone moſt commonly of invincible hardneſs, nothing inferiour to any Iron or Steel of the excellenteſt ſort; notwithſtanding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we ſee of them that are nothing, but a dry lump of Earth, and yet of thoſe alſo ſome are ſtronger in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, than divers of the hard ſtones are: which Earthly Magnets, if a man aſſay to bring them into faſhion by grinding on a Grinding-ſtone (according to the common uſe) they will conſume into very Mud in the Water. Now (to draw towards an end of this matter) albeit that the Magnetical virtue be moſt eminent in the Magnet, as in the preciſe and perfect ſubject thereof: yet it is the ſelf ſame quality, in a meaner degree, evidently to be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:187773:51"/> perceived in every piece of Earth, prepared and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as is aforeſaid) yea, although it be not cooled with his ends North and South, that it may take its Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical force from the virtue of the Earth, for if you cool it with his ends but Eaſt and Weſt, and ſet two Load-ſtones in the cooling, the one at one end and the other at the other end, it will receive a ſenſible and apparant Magnetical Virtue, according to thoſe points of the Load-ſtone that were applyed unto it; namely, that end which was next to the South point of the Load-ſtone will have a North property, and that end that was next the North point, will have a South property; yea, if you ſet the North part of two Load-ſtones to each end, both ends of this new made Magnets will have a South property; and contrariwiſe if you apply the South ends of two Magnets, both his ends will have a North property; and thoſe properties before mentioned will ſhew themſelves Magnetical, becauſe whether end of this new Magnet draweth any one end of a Magnetical Needle, the ſame will cauſe away the other: which is proper only to Magnets and Magnetical Bodies. After the like ſort, only by application of two ſtrong Load-ſtones by the force of twenty four hours you may alter the points of any baſe Load-ſtone, which you would, and make them both North and South as you pleaſe: ſo that the Load-ſtone that you would alter be but baſe in quality, and not great in ſubſtance, and that the other be of a reaſonable bigneſs and good ſtrength. And this virtue by ſuch an application of two Load-ſtones I have often found effectual in new Brick lately taken from the Kill without any farther putting into the fire at all, and although it be againſt the nature of the Load-ſtone to have both his ends naturally of one virtue, that is to ſay both of them of a North property, or both of them of a South property: yet here is to be underſtood, that it is the forcible violence of the ſtrong ones, being applyed joyntly to each end of the weak, that do chaſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:187773:52"/> property of the weak one into the middle thereof; and therefore if you divide this weak one in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, then both thoſe ends which being joyned together in the middle (where no Load-ſtone can ſhew any vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue) being now diſjoynted and become both ends, will preſently ſhew a contrary property (according to the Magnetical Nature) unto the other two ends.</p>

               <p>Where-hence it followeth neceſſarily, that always the one half of the <hi>Magnetical Meridian</hi> is on the Eaſt ſide, and the other on the Weſt ſide of the true <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> the common <hi>Zenith</hi> or <hi>Nadir</hi> evermore keeping their equal diſtances from the Poles of the one of them, as they do from the other.

For thus alſo very well it may be termed, by the property of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I do mean with Doctor <hi>Gilbert,</hi> the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontical motion of the Magnetical Needle, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination or inclination. I mean the deſcending (and as it were) the ſinking motion of the Needle under the Horizon, in his proper <hi>Azimuth</hi> or <hi>Magnetical Meridian;</hi> but if there be no variation, the Needle always point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the true <hi>Meridian</hi> of the Earth, and towards the Poles thereof, in both thoſe properties. The true Poles of the Earth, which are thoſe two points equally diſtant from each part of the Equinoctial of the Earth, are always the ſelf ſame. The reſpective Poles alter with every Horizon, where there is any variation, but never out of the forenamed <hi>Almicanter</hi> of that place. The cauſe of the differences of the reſpective Poles and Meridians from the true Poles and Meridians, and ſo of all Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are only two; the chief and moſt general is the vaſtneſs of the Ocean Sea, by moiſtneſs whereof the Magnetical collateral force of ſo much Earth as it cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is much hindered and dulled. And by what means the next great continent hath more power over the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent end of the Magnetical Needle, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would have if all were alike, one entire conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; and therefore cauſeth the directive property of the Needle ſomewhat to ſwarve towards that way, which is that which we call variation; but yet the vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Ocean doth not hinder the declination of the Magnetical Needle, becauſe the hanging conſiſteth but in length and bredth, and not in the depth. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in compariſon of a Pond or River, the Sea is ſaid to be of a wonderful depth, yet if this depth be compared with a Semidiameter of the Earth, it beareth a very exceeding ſmall proportion, nothing at all to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mighty magnetical declinatory force of the whole Earth; for the greateſt depth that ever any man of ſkill eſteemed it at, was not above two <hi>Engliſh</hi>

It is impoſſible that any variation be above 90 degrees, becauſe the virtue of the whole can never be overſwayed by the imperfection of a part, and eſpecially of ſo ſmall a part is any one portion of the Ocean is in his very ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in reſpect of the body of the whole Earth: yea I am verily perſwaded, that there never was nor never will be any Variation, by any good obſervation found to be ſo much as 90, neither any ſhew of ſo great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation any where, except it be very near unto either of the poles, where there is ſmall credit to be given to the obſerving of any variation: for the variation being (as before ſaid) the difference of the pointing of the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Needle in the Horizon, from the true <hi>Meridian,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:187773:57"/> for as much as in places near the pole, there is no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of certainty of either of theſe, it is not poſſible to find the variation if there be any. The reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this, no man may Travel in thoſe Seas, but whilſt the Sun abideth on that ſide of the <hi>Aequatour,</hi> whereby they have continual day, and by that means are ſeclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from any help of the Stars; neither if they might be ſeen, would they bring any great help. For the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of height in many hours is ſo ſmall, that by a large Inſtrument a diligent obſerver with great pains will hardly find the <hi>Meridian Line,</hi> all the <hi>Meridians</hi> thereof coming ſo near one to another, and meeting in the Pole, and their Horizon being in a manner parallel to the Aequinoctial. As for the Horizontical Magnetical Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to ſhew their pointing in the Horizon as they were wont to do, they coming into the Climate may ſay <hi>Fui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Troes.</hi> Their direction is as it were giddy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and when their center cometh unto the pole it ſelf, it is quite vaniſhed away; for from thence all the points of the Horizon are only South, if it be at the South pole, and North from the South, and therefore in that place the Inſtrument of declination is far more ſure then the Horizontical Compaſs. And as in the poles themſelves there is no direction at all, ſo of neceſſity near unto them it muſt be a very confuſed direction. Thoſe two places that are called the poles, have no ſtrength of themſelves (as aforeſaid) but as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto them of the whole. As in a Magnet, if you break off a piece of a contrary end, the end that is leſt will be according to that proportion diminiſhed in his ſtrength, and the polar piece, and the polar piece that is broke off (be it never ſo little) will have two poles as well as the great, ſo that the two parts will have four poles, two of them North, and two of them South. Put this little piece that was broken off in his place again, and then each piece will looſe one of his poles at the very ſame inſtant, and the whole will have but two
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:187773:57"/> poles, the one North and the other South, as at the firſt. Again, if you cut off of one ſide a piece of the Load-ſtone, that is brought into a round of an Ovall form, having his poles marked in their due places at each end, preſently both ends will be abridged of part of the force which they had, and the poles themſelves will be removed unto the other ſide, from the places that were marked, and thoſe marks will ſtand but for idle ciphers in compariſon of that they were before. Again, take a Magnet of an old or an extended Ovall form: I do ſtill exemplify in theſe, becauſe they are of all others, as I have often admoniſhed, for all Magnetical proof the moſt excellent forms, and ſet marks on the two poles, take a fine Needle, or any ſtreight ſmall Wyar, and ſet it on the Equinoctial (mean thereby the middle, between the two ends of the ſtone) then will it point directly towards each pole, if the ſtone be ſound without any flaws, or any other groſs ſubſtance (as may be) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with it: and if you thruſt this Needle towards either end, according to his own direction, he will trace you a circle right over both of theſe marked poles, which is the true <hi>Meridian</hi> of the ſtone. But if this ſtone hath on either of the ſides any imperfection, when the Needle cometh to the edge or brink thereof, it will ſwarve ſomewhat towards the ſounder ſide, and will point to neither of the true poles. And if a circle be drawn according to his pointing, as he ſtandeth ſtill in that place, this ſhall be a reſpective <hi>Meridian</hi> of that ſtone, proper unto that place, and the poles. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective poles differing from the true <hi>Meridian</hi> of the ſtone and his poles. Now if you thruſt the Needle farther towards the end, upon the brink of this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, it will not point (as before) but either fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, or nearer to the true poles, and will give his direction for a new reſpective <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ridian,</hi> and new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective poles, and in ſuch manner infinitely, if you place the Needle in the middle of this imperfection, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:187773:58"/> diſtant from the ſound parts, then will it indeed point towards the end of the ſtone, and the conſequence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the main reaſon, and that towards the middeſt of the Ocean; and likewiſe of any great continent there is no variation. Thus may you eſpecially in a round Load-ſtone (as in a lively example) ſee the true cauſes of all the variations that are in the whole World, reckoning as much ſpace as the Ocean covereth, to be ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the body of the whole, in reſpect of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontical motion of the Compaſs. For the evidence of the truth hereof, let a man examine generally the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the moſt expert Navigators (although by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diverſities of the ſets of their Compaſſes, and unfitneſs and unapt handling of their Inſtruments, they ſeldom times agree amongſt themſelves) obſerved in the <hi>Atlantick Ocean,</hi> from the <hi>Aequatour</hi> unto the parts of <hi>Norway,</hi> all along the Eaſt Coaſt, from the <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> of the <hi>Azores,</hi> ſo as far North, as hereunto has been diſcovered, and he ſhall find the ordinary practice to teſtifie the truth hereof, as alſo after the ſame ſort from the <hi>Aequatour</hi> Southward, unto the ſtreights of <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> and all along the back ſide of <hi>America</hi> in the South Sea: on the Eaſt Coaſt on the Cape of <hi>Bona Speranza,</hi> and he ſhall perceive the like agreeement, but in Sailing from the cap of <hi>Bona Speranza,</hi> farther farther Eaſtward that ſometimes they do find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the cauſe is the different manner of the ſituation of the South, as yet undiſcovered continent. And whereas in the middeſt of the <hi>Atlantick Ocean,</hi> about 30 Leagues Weſt from the <hi>Azores,</hi> they find no variation at all, no mervail thereof; for it is about the middle diſtance between the two great Continents of <hi>America</hi> and Ours.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the round Load-ſtone is ſignificantly termed by Doctor <hi>Gilbert Terrella,</hi> that is, a little, or rather a very little Earth; for it repreſenteth in a little ſmall modell (as it were) the admirable proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Magnetical of the huge Globe of the Earth; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo we may behold the reaſon why the Magnetical
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:187773:58"/> Needle varieth leaſt in the Aequinoctial, and moſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the pole, and in the poles themſelves giveth no direction at all: for proof hereof, take a Needle and place it on the Aequinoctial of the ſtone, there you ſhall ſee ſtand equally ballanced and very ſtrongly, ſo that if you turn him from the direction, as ſoon as you let him go, he will preſently again turn to it. The reaſon is, becauſe each pole doth equally ſtrengthen his correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent end of the Needle. Move this Needle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards either of the poles, then doth the nearer pole ſtrengthen his end of the Needle; but the farther (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the diſtance) cannot do the like unto his, but very weakly, and this Needle will not ſtand any more equally ballanced (as it did in the Aequinoctial) but that end next to the pole will couch down, and the other will riſe up, for on the North ſide of the <hi>Aequatour,</hi> the true South end is predominant, and on the other the North end hath the Maſtery. And that this is alſo in the Earth it ſelf, all our late Travellers confirm unto us by their daily experience, and all the very Artizans and Needle-makers muſt needs be daily witneſſes of it. As for Example, let any Workman in our Climate make a Needle for a Dyal, when he hath fitted it and placed it on the pin, that it may ſtand thereon equally ballanced and parallel to the Horizon, touch it with the Load-ſtone, then preſently that which pointeth towards the North will hang down; yea (although you touch only with the South end) and will not ſtand as before, the touch equally ballanced and parallel to the Horizon: except that you cut or file ſomewhat from that end that hangeth down, or elſe add a piece of Wax or ſome other thing to the other end of the Needle to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, and make it ſtand equidiſtant as it did at the firſt ſetting on: and this is a thing very certain, that is, the Northerly deſcent of the Needle, will be more or leſs in all places of Northerly Latitude: in the greater Latitude the more, and in the leſſer Latitude the leſſer.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:187773:59"/> But if any Traveller carry this Needle beyond the <hi>Aequatour</hi> in the like Latitude Southerly, that end which is downwards in the Northerly, will riſe Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the other ſink down even as much: and the nearer you Travel towards either pole, the more that end which pointeth towards the pole will tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: this is moſt certain in every Dyal Needle, but a great deal more appeareth in a long one then in a ſhort one; we cannot find that the property of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Magnetical Needle hath been unlargly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (for Sailing) above 300 years. And as for the property of declination under the Horizon, thereby to ſhew the Latitude by the Inſtrument thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is as yet a very new come Gueſt into the World, born and bred with us in <hi>England,</hi> and except it had been in exceeding few mens hands, yet much uſed, much leſs come unto his perfection. But this is not to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed at becauſe it is not above 60 years old; neither is it to be wondered at if any Critical Fellows do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and deride it, foraſmuch at either their want of knowledge, or of patience, will not give them leave truly to conſider of it. But what Navigatour, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nugatour whatſoever contemneth it, ſhall be ſure to repent if ever he comes to his right wits to conſider what it is that he hath contemned. And although the Needles for direction and declination do differ much in their ſhapes, each from the other, yet the properties are both one and the ſame. For the Needles for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection do decline (as aforeſaid) as far as the unfitneſs of their form and place will permit them: and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Needle will not work, but only in his <hi>Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Meridian,</hi> which himſelf will find out, if you turn the Inſtrument about, untill the Needle ſhew his leaſt declination under the Horizon, and there do play up and down, and ſtop in the end of the ſame place again. But if you would have a Needle fitted to ſhew both his properties, do thus, cauſe a Needle to be made about
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:187773:59"/> ſix Inches long, even and ſmooth, ſaving that he muſt be a little bigger in the middle, then inſtead of an Axis (which declinatory Needles have) let him have a ſmall hole drilled preciſely in the middeſt, and this hole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſmall, let it be ſomewhat wider outwards on each ſide then in the middeſt (which our Workmen call Sinkboared) where it muſt be left very ſharp, even almoſt as the edge of a Knife: put through this hole a ſmall Virginal Lattin Wyer, and fit the Needle ſo that it hang preciſely even upon this Wyer, inſtead of an Axletree: then touch him with the Loadſtone, and you ſhall preſently ſee the end that ſhould point towards the North, decline or bend down to his due point of decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if it be placed in the Magnetical <hi>Meridian,</hi> and ſet a little piece of Wax or any other thing upon the contrary part for a counterpoiſe in that the Needle may ſtand parallel with the Horizon, then if you ſtand at right angles with that Virginal Wyer, it is certainly in the Magnetical <hi>Meridian,</hi> ſo that hanging in this counterpoſe, if you turn about the Wyer untill the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle do make right Angles with it, then doth the Needle by his directive virtue point unto the Magnetical <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Line. Take off the counterpoiſe, then it ſheweth the declination; ſo that one and the ſelf ſame Needle in the ſame place only, by taking off, and putting on a little piece of Wax, ſheweth plainly both thoſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of directions and declinations, and in like manner every inclinatory Needle will do, if the points of his Axis be ſharp, and held in his box parallel to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, he will ſhew both thoſe properties of direction and declination: a fine piece of Cork or Leather, or any Tough ſubſtance may ſerve this Needle for a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe in all Latitudes by thruſting it towards the center in the leſs Latitudes, and towards the end in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I think it not impoſſible, but that a ſkilful Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometrician may ſo graduate the one half of ſuch a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, that it alone with its counterpoiſe, may be a means
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:187773:60"/> to give a probable conjecture for the Latitude of any place whatſoever.</p>
               <p>It will be very convenient in the next place to make a diſcovery of the Errours committed in making and touching Magnetical Needles and Wyers of Sayling Compaſſes, and to give adviſe for the true and right making and touching of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Wyers that are commonly made both with us, and in forrain Countries, are of ſo baſe and droſſie Iron, not apt or ſufficient to receive the tenth part of the virtue that fine ſteel Wyer could do.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:187773:63"/> quench it in cold Water ſuddenly, ſo is it Brick in a manner or Glaſs it ſelf, and is at that time incapable of the virtue of the Load-ſtone. Then muſt you, laying it upon a plain Table, warily rub with fine Sand all the black colour from it, if before you put into the fire you anoint it with black Soap it will ſcale white it ſelf, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> heat a Bar of Iron well near red hot, and holding one end of the Needle with a ſmall pair of Tongues, lay the other end upon the hot Bar, and preſently you ſhall ſee that end turn from a white to a yellowiſh, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to a blewiſh colour, then take that end with your Tongues, and do the like to the other, thruſting it forwards upon the Bar untill the colour of the whole Needle become blewiſh; then throw it on a Table, and let it cool it ſelf; and ſo is he of the excellent temper, and moſt capable to receive the greateſt power from the Load-ſtone. If this ſeem too curious, eſpecially for ſome faſhions of Needles, then uſe but the Hammer hardening (as Workmen call it) which is well near as good. As concerning the form, divers men are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers minds, ſome uſe a kind of a ſquare one, others a Loop (I mean an extended Ovall form) and this is moſt common; but now a days a narrow ſtreight plate (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat broader in the middle) is in great requeſt: of theſe I hold the Loop or Ovall form (if it be well made) to be the beſt, which is, that if it be Steel, his ends be welded together, having a Lattin narrow plate, iſſuing from the capitell unto the middle of the two ſides of the Loop, and there rivited, and riviting, if it be handſomely ſhoulered in by the Workman, is better than ſoadering; becauſe having fitted the Lattin plate, bearing the capitell unto the Loop, you may firſt put your Loop into his temper, and then rivet this unto him afterwards, which otherwiſe would be ſpoiled in the fire, and the wide Loop is better then the narrow or the ſtreight plate, and that for two reaſons. The one is becauſe, as in a Magnet it ſelf, the force that is
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:187773:63"/> in the whole body, ſheweth it ſelf moſt ſtrongly in his two Poles, even ſo, this being a Magnetical Body, doth the like in his ends, which are his Poles: and the end of a wide compaſſed Loop, (being longer than of a narrower) of the ſame length, in the Axis, muſt needs contain ſo much the more Vertue; The other reaſon is, becauſe it ſuppoſeth the Flie in his Circular Motion, more equally ballanced then the other: and therefore were it not for ſome other Inconveniences, a true Circle were beſt of all, which that except you mark the two places, that you would have for the North and South, very curiouſly, you ſhall never give him the right touch; yea very exceeding hardly, although that you do mark them; and alſo the Lattine <hi>Stay,</hi> that holdeth the Capital would be exceeding long, and a ſuperfluous burden; but the beſt form of all (as I take it) in all reſpects is this, A true Circle, having his Axis go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out beyond the Circle, at each end narrow and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, unto a reaſonable ſharp point, and being pure Steel as the Circle it ſelf, having in the midſt, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Receptacle to place the Capital fitly in.</p>
               <p>This Circle muſt have four very ſmall holes drilled through it, equally diſtant each from the other, for the four Cardinal Points; and in both the two Points, that iſſue without the Circle, being for North and South, of equal diſtance between the Circle and the end of the Point two more; if it be a large one, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe one is enough, according to the following Figure. And this Needle is moſt fit to be uſed for the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Variation without any Flie, as I will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhew.</p>

               <p>Whenſoever you will ſet this Needle unto the Flie, you muſt put the Capital through the Center of the Flie very preciſely, and placing the Points of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter where you will have them, thruſt little ſmall pins through the upper place of the Flie, and thoſe ſmal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, If you pleaſe to place this Needle upon the upper end of the Card according to <hi>Stevinius</hi> thorough the Center, in the bottom of the Flie, and the Needle placed and faſtened on the top, or upper face of the Card.</p>
               <p>But if you will have a Magnetical Needle to ſerve only for one ſize of a Flie, the beſt way is, inſtead of the two pins in the end of the Axis, to have a couple of little half Staples, and a Flower-de-Luce on one of them, as you ſee in the Loop revitted there. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in turning about the Needle, they may ſtill keep the Flie cloſe unto it, and ſo faſten it upon a Skrew upon the Capital, whereſoever you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>As for his weight, it muſt be according to his large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the weight is one principal cauſe, the very large Compaſſes are unprofitable. For the weight of the weight of the large Card, and the heavy Needle, preſſing upon the pin, will cauſe the Motion of the Flie to be dull and uncertain; and therefore let the Paſteboard be no heavier then you muſt needs; and for the ſize of ſix Inches Diameter of your Paſte-board, and a Needle of that length. I know that a Needle of half an Ounce weight, and half a quartern at the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, (if a good Workman have it in hand) will be fully ſufficient of what Form ſoever.</p>
               <p>The Capital ought to be Lattin, and Hammer-hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, well and truly boared, not too ſhallow, but of a good convenient depth and wideneſs at the bottom, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ing the pin it ſtandeth upon at the top.</p>
               <p>The Pin ought to be either of Lattin or Copper, and not of Steel or Iron, as ſome ſuppoſe, for they are very ſubject to ruſt; and the Steel, eſpecially by long uſe, will wear a little hole in the top of the Capital, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y that means the Compaſs becometh dull, and they hardly if ever will find the reaſon of it; for the hole will be very ſmall; and entring a very little way in, and yet diſturbeth all. Moreover in any wiſe there
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:187773:65"/> muſt be always an eſpecial diligent Care had of fitneſs between the Capital and the Pin, otherwiſe all things appertaining to the Compaſs are nothing worth. This Pin muſt be very firmly fixed in the juſt Center of the Box, and the bottom marked, that whenſoever you take it off to ſharpen the Pin (which uſe will make blunt) you may ſet him in the ſame place again.</p>
               <p>As I have ſaid, that in a Magnet it ſelf, the Vertue is in the whole body, and ſheweth it ſelf moſt forcible in its Poles; even ſo likewiſe our Compaſs Needle, being a Magnetical body, ſheweth his force in his ends, which are his Poles, although that force doth proceed out of the whole body of the Needle; which I have now thought good to make apparent by an evident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration: I cauſed my Workman to make a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a Loop Faſhion, eight Inches long, or Oval Form, in all reſpects fitted to be ſet to a Flie, ſaving that there was but one Inch or a little more at each end of the Steel, all the intermediate part between the two ends being of Braſs: Theſe two ends I did touch with the North and South ends of a very good Magnet: and whereas in a true Magnetical Needle, I ſhould have had but two points, the one North, and the other South, this Mongrel yielded me ſix, the two ends adjoyning to the braſs of contrary natures unto the ſharp Points, and would no more do the Office of a Magnetical Needle then a wooden ſtick, becauſe the Vertue was not in the whole, and ſo communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the two ends, but each end was a Total of himſelf, being ſeparated, and as it were divorced, the one from all communication with the other, by that intermediate braſs: the which being taken away, and the two Forks joined together for that length, preſently he became one perfect true Magnetical Needle, and the Vertue of thoſe four confuſed Points, which ere while was loſt in the Forks, will preſently be found in the two ſharp ends, and now in his natural Seats.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:187773:65"/>
               <figure>
                  <head>Both theſe ends of Steel were faſtened to the Braſs, and then that Needle had no Magnetical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but being taken off and joyned together, they preſently (without any further touching of them) became a true Magnetical Needle.</head>
               </figure>
               <p>To conclude this diſcourſe of the Compaſs of the Needle, the needle that is ſtill working upon his Pin continually, will keep his force the better, then that which otherwiſe laid up, although there be no doubt of the other, for a mans whole Age, or longer, if it
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:187773:66"/> be of good Mettal, and kept from open Air and Ruſt, but eſpecially of any Load-ſtone. There is no better way of keeping from ruſt, then by varniſhing him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be but with a drop or two of Linſed-Oyl alone, the Needle that is continually upon his Pin, is ſtill ſtrengthened by the Magnetical power of the Earth, ſetting himſelf always towards the Poles thereof (which the other cannot do) and needeth only to have his pin ſharpened only now and then: the which of all the faults incident to the compaſs, is moſt eaſily and ſafely amended. And yet if it be not very well looked unto, it diſturbeth all the operation of the Compaſs more then any other.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:187773:66"/> over the middeſt of the circle, cut out of the ſame place with the circle, or elſe ſoadered with Silver ſoader: this muſt have a line all along the middeſt of it, and a little loop at each end cut through the two ends of the loops being preciſely in that line. Laſtly, you muſt have a moveable Ruler with two long folding ſights, of about the Semidiameter of the circle in the breadth above half an Inch: the one of them muſt have a flit through the length thereof, of about a quarter of an Inch broad, as you ſhall think convenient, and two lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle holes, the one in the top, and the other in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, juſt in the middle of it, to faſten a ſtring, having a very little bead to ſlide up and down upon it. And this ſight muſt be of thicker ſtuff then the other; for otherwiſe becauſe of that which is cut out it would be overpoiſed by the other, and ſo the box would ſwarve towards the other; and the ſights muſt each of them have a little notch in the middeſt of the top of them: this Ruler muſt be faſtened (but yet ſo that he may turn about) in the middle of the croſs plate moſt preciſely in the center of the circle, his ends cut, that he may ſhew the Fiducial Line in the diviſions of the circle, the other ſight needeth to be but a plain plate, having a line in the middle, from the top to the bottom, being the very ſame in ſubſtance with that which we call the compaſs of variation; although in all things eaſier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with this, then with that.</p>
               <p>The Compaſs being thus fitted, place the circular Needle upon his pin alone, without any flie. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſburdened of the Card, he will ſhew his virtue the more ſtrongly, and being of the right form, he will ballance himſelf ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>Place the circle upon the Glaſs and Paſt-board; in ſuch a manner that you may turn the circle round about, very cloſe and even, within the brim of the box.</p>
               <p>When you will ſet the ſame unto the Compaſs, turn the circle about, untill thorough the Loops of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:187773:67"/> ſtay or plate, you ſee the Axis of the Needle right under the Fiducial Line of the middle ſtay, then hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the circle ſo, turn the moveable Ruler with the ſtringed ſight towards the Sun, untill the ſhaddow of the ſtring fall upon the Fiducial Line of the moveable Ruler, for then doth the end of the Ruler, among the degrees, ſhew the true place or azimath of the Sun from the Magnetical Meridian, ſo that two obſervations ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ariſe from hence, the one in the Forenoon, the other in the Afternoon, thus made, with the ſeveral heights of the Sun, being one and the very ſame, half the differances of thoſe places of the Sun, from the Magnetical Needle is the variation.</p>
               <p>If a man have no exact Inſtrument to take the height of the Sun, he may make ſome reaſonable ſhift, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the middle bead towards the top of the ſtring, that it may in the Forenoon caſt a ſhaddow upon the Fiduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Line of the Ruler; and marking that place with Ink or Black-Lead, in the Afternoon attend, untill the ſhaddow of the bead (the bead remaining ſtill where it was full upon the place) for then ſhall you have that ſame height, if you will take the amplitude of the Suns riſing or ſetting, ſet the circle, and turn the Ruler as before, untill the ſhaddow of the ſtring do fall upon the middle Line of the other ſight. Then doth the end of the Ruler ſhew how far the Sun riſeth or ſetteth from the Magnetical Meridian.</p>
               <p>When you will take the Amplititude of the riſing or ſetting of any Star, you muſt uſe the help of another, to hold the circle over the Needle (as before) and ſo you turning of the Ruler, untill you ſee the Star in his riſing or ſetting, through the two notches on the tops of the ſights, then doth the end of the Ruler ſhew your deſire.

               <p>The Horizontical and Inclinatory motions of Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:187773:67"/> Needles are both of them but one and the ſame effect of the Magnet or Load-ſtone, the making of the Horizontical or Dial-Needle, it is amongſt our Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers very well known and trivial, only they are to be put in mind that they do always make them of pure Steel and not of Iron. But as for the making of Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Needles, it is a very curious piece of work: it muſt be of pure Steel, and in his right temper, the Needle and Axis muſt be as right Angles the one with the other, and muſt be ſo hanged on the two ends of his Axis, that he be very pliant for his motion, and that before (he have his touch) he be ſo equally ballanced, that the one end be not one jot heavier then the other, for if it be, all the reſt is in vain.</p>
               <p>When you will uſe the inclinatory Inſtrument, thus you muſt do, hanging by his little Ring, turn him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout untill he make his leaſt declination (or inclination) under the Horizon of the Inſtrument: for then is he juſt in his Magnetical Meridian, and there ſheweth his due point, the which otherwiſe he can never do. But here I muſt forewarn you of two great errours publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the contriving of this Noble Inſtrument. The one is, that he would have a little box with a Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Needle faſtened unto the bottom of the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Inſtrument: for to direct the Inſtrument unto the Magnetical Meridian; and by his picture of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his diſtance ſhould be but a little more then an Inch, whereby it is impoſſible but that the one Needle muſt needs diſturb the other, ſo that neither of them can ſhew a right, yea, although they were ſix Inches aſſunder and more, where the little box will give little direction for that purpoſe: and beſides that, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unneceſſary, becauſe the Inſtrument will find the Magnetical Meridian, by the leaſt declination of the Needle (as is before ſhewed) under the Horizon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of any other. The other errour is this, that he would have that end of the Needle prepared
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:187773:68"/> to hang towards the North, to be framed ſomewhat higher then the other, as it is uſual in Horozontical needles; what Workman ſoever obſerveth this Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I will aſſure him, that he ſhall looſe his labour, and as ſoon may he waſh a <hi>Blackamore</hi> white, as to make ſuch a needle as that turn. The reaſon is, becauſe it is only the Magnetical Vertue that worketh this effect, the which over-weight, in the either end of the needle (in this Motion) doth utterly overthrow.</p>
               <p>For Horozontical needles in our Northern Climates, it is neceſſary; but for inclinatory needles, it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly untrue in all Climates of the whole World where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. The Motion of the Horozontical needle, is naturally ſtronger then the Inclinatory, for two cauſes, the one is, becauſe his Motion is only ſide-ways, the which is the eaſier for the Magneaical Motion to work in, then that which is up and down, and there is no difference which way you place the Box wherein he ſtandeth, ſo that it be parallel to the Horizon; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Inclinatory Motion is in a Vertical Circle up and down, and muſt ſtand only in his Magnetical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian to perform his Office. The other cauſe, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Diverſity of their placing in their Boxes; for the Horizontical needle ſtandeth more fitter for his Motion, being placed with his Capital upon the point of a ſharp Pin, than the Inclinatory can do, being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon the two ends of his Axis, although never ſo near the Points: But yet he will do very well if he be rightly fitted? and for Navigation under either Pole (if there be any paſſage that way) it is the only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the World, for where the Horozontical needle (or Compaſs) faileth, he is ſtrongeſt, for the nearer the Pole, the ſtronger he is in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>otion; contrariwiſe, it is with the Horozontical needle or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, for he is ſtrongeſt at the Equinoctial, and of no force under the Pole.</p>

               <p>The reaſon whereof is this, under the Equinoctial the Horozontical needle ſtandeth parallel unto the Axis of the Earth, and is equally ſtrengthened for his Motion with the two Poles of the Earth; but under the Poles, he ſtandeth croſs-wiſe at right Angles with the Axis, his Center repreſenting the very Pole of the Earth it ſelf; ſo that the Equinoctial, and the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon being there all one, if the needle ſhould have any Horozontical Motion there, it muſt needs be an Eaſt or Weſt Motion parallel unto the Equinoctial, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to Nature, and to all Magnetical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>Yet at the Pole the Inclinatory needle is at his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtrength, framing himſelf to be in the ſame direct Line with the Axis of the Earth it ſelf: ſo that the Vicinity of the neareſt Pole of the Earth, holdeth his convenient end of the needle moſt ſtrongly, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all hindered by the adverſe Pole, to affect the upper (or other) end of the needle: The which all other Scituations either more or leſs it doth, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially under the Equinoctial, where each Pole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting his convenient end of the Inclinatory needle, it muſt ſtand very untowardly and unſteadily for that Motion; although moſt ſtrongly for the Horizontical if you place him accordingly.</p>
               <p>Where hence it followeth, that near the Equinoctial Large Compaſſes, and ſmall Inclinatories are fitteſt; and near the Poles large Inclinatories, and ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes are beſt, for look unto what Motion the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical force is weakeſt, the ſmaller Inſtrument ought to be applyed.</p>
               <p>And moreover, foraſmuch as the Magnetical Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Inclinatory needle, about the Globe of the Earth maketh his Motion for the difference of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alteration of Latitude to the Equinoctial, far more large and eaſier to be diſcerned, then it can be near the Poles; therefore (as we have ſaid) a leſs Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:187773:69"/> will ſerve the turn there: and becauſe that near the Pole, his Motion for differences of Latitudes are exceeding ſmall, and hard to be diſcerned: Therefore very large Inſtruments Inclinatory are there to be uſed, eſpecially becauſe the Magnetical ſtrength of the the Needle for that Motion, is there ſo ſtrong and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that it maketh ſome Recompence for the ſlowneſs of his moving; and therefore I ſuppoſe that three in Diameter, will ſerve near the Equinoctial, and fifteen near the Pole.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this great one may be the leſs cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, you may cut off the Circle at forty and five De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of each ſide of the Zenith and Nadir of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and yet leave the needle ſcope enough, for all the Latitudes between ſixty Degrees and the Pole; and for the ſteady ſtanding of the Inclinatory Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Sea, you may do thus; about the middle of the Inſtrument (or rather ſomewhat above the middle) let there be two round Pins of Braſs, about three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an Inch long, iſſue out; and in a Box of a ſayling Compaſs, the miner Circle being taken away, make of each ſide two half round notches in the outer Circle, and place the Inſtrument upon thoſe two Pins, the which muſt have towards their ends, little Circles cut in; that they ſlip not out of their rings that they are placed in; then will this Inſtrument ſtand as ſteady even at Sea, as the ſayling Compaſs will do; for the Motion of the miner Circle is performed by the turning of thoſe two Pius in their notches, and the outer Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is common unto them both, always remembring that you hang ſome pretty weight on the bottom of the Inſtrument, to make his Motion more certain: If the ſhadowing of the box hinder your ſight from diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Point that the needle ſtandeth at, it is ſoon helped with the light of a little wax Candle put down unto it; and yet this you ought to underſtand as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, that the Horozontical and Inclinatory Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:187773:69"/> are but one and the ſelf ſame Effect of the touch of the Load-ſtone, and one and the ſelf ſame needle will very well perform both Motions; namely, the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory needle, not the Horizontical, becauſe his placing upon the Pin maketh him very unfit for the Inclinato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Motion. But the Inclinatory needle reſting with one point of his Axis (the points of his Axis being very ſharp) in his little hole, his box being placed parallel to the Horizon, will perform the Horizontical Motion very well. For being placed with the ſharp point of the Axis in that hole, it is all one in effect, as the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontical is with his Capital on the ſharp point of his Pin, but that the one is upward, and the other down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and yet either of them being as fit for that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the other.</p>
               <p>Herein now appeareth the wonderful Wiſdom of our God, in limiting his Times and Seaſons, for the Revealing of theſe wonderful Properties for the uſe of Men, in the poor ſtone of the Magnes; namely, that (as ſome will have it) above 3000 years after that it was known and wondred at in the World, for lifting up Iron; (for it was ſaid to be, I know not upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, eſteemed as an Antiquity in <hi>Plato's</hi> time) the uſe of the Horizontical needle was not known in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe, much above 200 years ſince; and very few years after, (yea ſcarcely till of late) the Inclinatory hath been in any common uſe: And who is there that can behold and conſider both theſe uſes, <hi>viz.</hi> both to ſhew the Quarters of the World (as <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North</hi> and <hi>South, &amp;c.</hi>) And alſo the Latitude of place; to know both theſe in any place of the World, be the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens never ſo much over-caſt with Clouds; who is he I ſay, that can behold theſe two admirable and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſes performed, even with the turning of an hand; the which, neither the <hi>Grecian</hi> Philoſophers, nor the fine-witted <hi>Romans,</hi> nor the <hi>Perſian Magi,</hi> nor the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Cymnoſophiſts,</hi> could find out with all their skill
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:187773:70"/> and cunning, but he muſt needs ſay with that Kingly Prophet, <hi>O Lord, our Lord, How great is thy Name through all the Earth?

               <p>AFTER the Art of Navigation was found, every man began to challenge to himſelf the Dominion of the Sea, and to make War as on the Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Minos</hi> (as <hi>Strabo</hi> writes) firſt found out the Art of Navigation, and was thereof (as writeth <hi>Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>) appointed by <hi>Saturnus</hi> to be Admiral of the <hi>Navy:</hi> and therefore the poſterity afterwards aſcribed to him the government of the Sea, and named him the God thereof. But moſt beſtow this honour upon <hi>Neptune.</hi> After whom the <hi>Cretenſes</hi> were ever eſteemed moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in this Art.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:187773:71"/> is aſcribed to <hi>Noah,</hi> who (as writeth <hi>Euſebius</hi>) was long before <hi>Neptune</hi> or <hi>Danus.</hi> For doubtleſs (ſaith he) the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> was none other then a Ship, and the firſt and only exemplar of the building of all other Ships or Veſſels of Sayling. Aſo the moſt Ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Beroſus</hi> the <hi>Chaldean</hi> (as writeth <hi>Joſephus</hi>) calleth the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> a Ship.

For whereas no Art is ſo perfect, but may receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, therefore it follows that this Art hath been greatly augmented and brought to further perfection by the witty Inventions of Poſterity, even unto our Age. And amongſt all other curious Inventions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Ships, the Marriners Compaſs is moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Some notwithſtanding have been found, who have thought this Invention Ancient. <hi>Levinus Lemnius</hi> in his Third Book and fourth Chapter <hi>de occultis Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae Miraculis</hi> ſeems to doubt of it. <hi>An hoc Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Nauticum Miraculis ſuperioribus ſeculis extitit, an noſtro id aevo excogitatum:</hi> whether this Inſtrument of Navigation were in being in former Ages, or found out in later times, I cannot certainly define.

But for <hi>Plantus</hi> I dare ſay he was never guilty of ſuch a meaning: <hi>Turnebus</hi> by <hi>Verſoriam</hi> underſtanding the Rope with the Sayl, others the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with which the Ship is turned: neither of which are impertinent or improbable, ſo as there is no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:187773:71"/> of applying it to the Mrriners Compaſs. <hi>Stephen Paſquier</hi> in his 4th Book and 23th Chapter of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherches of <hi>France</hi> brings it up as high as the times of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> by the Verſes of one <hi>Hugh de Bercy,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his Reign, and as he pretends plainly deſcribes it; but whether the words are ſo plain as he makes them, or whether they were publiſhed by ſome other ſince <hi>Bercy,</hi> but in his Name, is very uncertain, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince no Poet or Hiſtoriographer contemporary with him, or more Ancient then he, are found to make mention thereof; and yet <hi>Lewis</hi> dyed not much above 300 years ſince. <hi>Pineda</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in his Lib. 4th <hi>de rebus Solomonis</hi> for the more commodious placing of Tharſhes in <hi>Spain,</hi> is confident that it was in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, making his univerſal wiſdom and deep inſight into the nature of all things, the principal ground of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: But <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſdom though it were univerſal and deep, beyond all the Children of the Eaſt, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as God gave him <hi>Latitudinem cordis,</hi> a large Heart, as the Sand on the Sea ſhore, yet was it finite and limited as well in things natural as ſupernatural. I doubt not but <hi>Adam</hi> in the State of his Integrity knew more then <hi>Solomon,</hi> and yet I dare not pronounce him Omniſcious, that being an attribute (as is likewiſe Omnipotencie, Ubiquity, and Eternity) individually proper to the Godhead, and incommunicable to any created ſubſtance, though mearly incorporeal, whether they be the damned or the bleſſed Spirits. If then the Holy Angles, if <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe knew not all things; nay, if the Son of God himſelf, as he was Man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelf to be Ignorant of ſome things, why ſhould we then think it ſtrange to affirm, that <hi>Solomon</hi> knew not all things. If there be ſuch a ſecret as the Artificial Tranſmutation of other Mettals into Gold, (which by the experiments of many is confidently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched) it is more then probable that he was Ignorant of it; for had he knew it, he needed not to have ſent his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:187773:72"/> Navy to <hi>Ophir</hi> or <hi>Tharſhis</hi> for Gold; as likewiſe had he known the ſecret of the Loadſtone, his Navy need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to have ſpent three years in going and coming, neither ſhould his Marriners have needed to have crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Sydonians,</hi> as Pilots for the better conducting of them in their Voyage. I conclude then that either <hi>Solomon</hi> knew not this ſecret, or if he knew it he put it not into practice, or if he put it in practice, it was ſince loſt and recovered again, which to me ſeemeth the ſtrangeſt of all.</p>
               <p>Now to the Authority of theſe three, who plead for the Antiquity of this Invention, may be oppoſed thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and thoſe in Learning nothing inferious, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it to have been an Invention of latter Ages, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Ancients, as <hi>Acoſta, Mariana, Maluenda, Gomara, Turnebus, Pancirollus, Salmuth, Lillius, Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus, Cardan, Bozius, Bodin, Ramus.</hi> And to theſe might be added many more, were I ambitious in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering up of Names, or did the cauſe require it. For queſtionleſs this our Age may not only ſeem to contend with the Ancients, but alſo for many goodly Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Art and Wit, do far exceed them, not to ſpeak of all the marvelous Inventions of our times (as we have already diſcourſed of the Marriners Compaſs) much alſo might be ſaid of the invention of Printing, and making of Guns, Fire-works, and of ſundry Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Fires, of ſuch marvelous force that Mountains of moſt hard Rocks and Stones are not able to reſiſt their violence, that neither the Spirit of <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> or the Thunderbolt of Infernal <hi>Pluto</hi> can do the like. What ſhould I here ſpeak of the wonderful Inventions of <hi>Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talio</hi> in his Book <hi>de Arte Majori:</hi> or of any other where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Vanucius Peringocius</hi> writheth in his Book Intituled <hi>Pyrotechnie.</hi> As touching which terrible inventions, and the like, although men are of Opinion that they were Invented by the Inſtigation of the Devil, for the deſtruction of Mankind: yet others weiging
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:187773:72"/> the matter more indifferently, think that the Invention of Guns hath been the occaſion of the ſaving of many mens Lives, becauſe before the Invention and Uſe of them, men were wont to lye a long time a battering of Walls, Towns, Caſtles, but in ſhort time it comes to hand, ſtroakes, with which the <hi>Aries, Onagri, Catwpulta,</hi> or <hi>Baliſtae,</hi> Engines of the Ancients) which I know not very well how to Engliſh, they being grown for the moſt part out of uſe) are no way comparable, <hi>nec ulla ex parte, huic conferendus eſt antiquus Aries, veres infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riores habebat, et difficilus ad muros adigebat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricius,</hi> the Ram anciently for Batterie, is in no ſort to be compared with this Engin, it hath leſs ſtrength, and more difficulty there was in bringing it, and applying of it to the Walls: And <hi>Bodin</hi> in the like purpoſe, (though herein perhaps he jump not with <hi>Lipſeus</hi> in his <hi>Poliorcetica) omitto Catapulta Veterum et antiqua belli termenta, quae ſi cum noſtris conferantur ſanc pueritia quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Ludricra videri poſſint:</hi> I pas over the Engines of the Ancients, which being compared with ours, are rather Childiſh toys then Inſtruments for War. And <hi>Lipſius</hi> himſelf calls it, <hi>Geniorum, non hominum inventum,</hi> an Invention of Spirits and not of Men. Such is the force (as we have in part ſaid) of theſe Modern En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, that they not only deſtroy Men, but caſt down Walls, Rampiers, Towers, Caſtles, Cities, and ſhake the Talleſt Ships into ſhivers, there being nothing that comes within their reach that can ſtand them. It was a piece almoſt of Incredible bigneſs, which by <hi>Mahomets</hi> command was imployed againſt <hi>Conſtantinople, ad quem trahendum adhibantur ſeptuaginta juga boum, et his mille viri,</hi> as witneſſeth <hi>Chalcondilus</hi> in his Eighth Book <hi>de Relus Turcicis,</hi> for the drawing of which were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeventy Yoake of Oxen, and two Thouſand Men. It is true there is nothing more miſchievous to Beſieged Cities, and ſo there is nothing that helps them more for the chaſing away of the Beſeigers; it being ſo for
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:187773:73"/> the moſt part in all things, which either the Art or Wit of man, or God and Nature hath framed, that the more helpful they are being well uſed, the more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are they being abuſed: then Fire and Water there are no things more commodious to the Life of Man, yet is the Proverb true, that when they are once inraged, and paſs their bounds, they become Mercileſs, Good Servants, but bad Maſters. The Tongue is ſaid by <hi>Aeſop</hi> to be the beſt and worſt Meat that comes to the Market: for with it we both bleſs God and curſe Men, ſaith St. <hi>James.</hi> And Iron by <hi>Pliny</hi> is rightly termed, <hi>Optimum, poſſimum<expan>

               <p>Howſoever ſome have not been wanting, who would bear us in hand that this Invention is not of Latter times, but Ancient; among whom <hi>Sir Walter Raleigh</hi> is one, who in his Hiſtory of the World, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. refers not only the Invention of Printing, but of Guns too, and Ordinance of Batterie to the <hi>Indians,</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf herein upon the report of the <hi>Portugals:</hi> and hereby, ſaith he, we are now made to underſtand, that the place of <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> in <hi>Vita Apolony Fianei,</hi> is no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though expreſſed in Fabulous words, when he ſaith, that the Wiſemen which dwell between <hi>Hyptheſis</hi> and <hi>Ganges</hi> uſe not themſelves to go forth to Battle, but that they drive away their Enemies with Thunder and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:187773:73"/> Lightning.

               <p>But <hi>Servius</hi> in his Commentaries concieves, that this imitation of Thunder was by driving his Chariot
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:187773:74"/> over a brazen Bridge; and if he uſed an Engine, it ſeems to have been rather for Ratling and Terror, then for any real Effect. And whereas great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance exceed Thunder, this was ſuch that it came far ſhort of it; And therefore as <hi>Rota</hi> hath well expreſſed, the Poet calls it.</p>
               <q>—non imitabile fulmen.</q>
               <p>But this I leave as a very uncertain ground for the ancient Invention of this Engine. <hi>Petarch</hi> and <hi>Valtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> upon better ſhew of reaſon (as they conceive) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to <hi>Archimedes,</hi> found out (as they pretend) by him for the overthrow of <hi>Marcellos Shippes</hi> at <hi>Syracuſe</hi> Siege. But it were ſtrange that both <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> who have written largely of his admirable Wit and wonderful Engines; and particularly of the Siege of that City, ſhould among the reſt forget this rare In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and yet more ſtrange, that the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the taking of the City, ſhould not take it up and make uſe of it: Nay, as <hi>Magius</hi> (who hath written a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to this purpoſe, to refute them who refer this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to the Ancients) hath obſerved; neither <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> nor <hi>Pappus,</hi> nor <hi>Athenens,</hi> nor <hi>Biton</hi> in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts of the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> (for printed they are not) have deſcribed any ſuch Engines, nor <hi>Aegidias Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> (who lived and wrote in the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> the fair King of <hi>France</hi>) about the year 1285) where he treats purpoſely of Warlike Engines and Inſtruments: yet remembers not any ſuch thing. <hi>Brightman</hi> in his Expoſition on the Revelation of St. <hi>John,</hi> tells us that by the Fire, and Smoak, and Brimſtone which in that place are ſaid to have iſſued out of the Mouths of the Horſes, are to be underſtood, our Powder and Guns now in uſe, and that of them St. <hi>John</hi> propheſied, But how theſe are ſaid to iſſue out of the Mouths of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:187773:74"/> he doth not well expreſs, nor I think well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>The Common Opinion then is, that this device was firſt found out by a Monk of <hi>Germany,</hi> whoſe name ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Writers affirm to be deſervedly loſt; but <hi>Forcatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> in his fourth book of the Empire and Phyloſophy of <hi>France</hi> names him <hi>Berthold Swartes</hi> of <hi>Cullen,</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Conſtantine Anklitzen</hi> of <hi>Friburg:</hi> Howſoever they all agree that he was a <hi>German</hi> Monk, and that by chance a ſpark of Fire falling into a pot of Niter, which he had prepared for Phyſick or Alchimy, and cauſing it to fly up, he thereupon made a Compoſition of Powder, with an Inſtrument of Braſs or Iron, and putting the fire to it found the Concluſion to anſwer his Expectation. The firſt publick uſe of Guns that we read of, was thought to be about the year 1380. as <hi>Magius,</hi> or 1400 as <hi>Ramus,</hi> in a battel betwixt the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Genoways,</hi> fought at <hi>Clodia Foſſa,</hi> in which the <hi>Venetians</hi> having from the Monk belike, gotten the uſe of Guns, ſo galled their Enemies, that they ſaw themſelves wounded and ſlain; and yet knew not by what means, nor how to prevent it, as <hi>Platina</hi> witneſſeth in the Life of <hi>

And therefore they are ſo moved <hi>per Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum, &amp;c.</hi> which is proved to be falſe. Furthermore, what St. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſaith touching this; any man that will, may read; for no man better underſtood the mind of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> But for the Examples, that <hi>Simplicius</hi> and <hi>Averroes</hi> give to the underſtanding of this (by two Spherical Bodies of equal Quantity, but of divers kinds, as one of Gold, and the other of Silver) we muſt not therefore ſay, that he underſtood this Propoſition as I will demonſtrate. For they ſhould have ſaid ſomwhat of the Equality of the Quantity of thoſe Bodies; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Motion of Bodies, equal and unequal, is all one, ſo that they be all one Figure: As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>If there be three Spherical Bodies, of the which two are of Gold, and the third Silver, and they of the Gold are unequal, and the other of Silver equal to one of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:187773:78"/> Golden Bodies; then in the ſame Proportion of time, ſhall be moved the Golden Body equal to that of Silver, with Silver Body, with the Golden uneqal, as ſhall be declared hereafter.</hi> Furthermore, 6 <hi>Phiſick Cap.</hi> 1. in the end, and in a manner through all the Chapter of the ſame Book, he confirmeth the ſame: but in the fourth he ſaith thus, whereas every thing that moveth, moveth in ſome other, and in ſome time, and that moveable is Motion of the whole, the ſame or all one ſhall be the Diviſions of the time and the moving, and of to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and of that which is moved as alſo of that in the which is moving. Afterward he giveth Demonſtration after his manner, but <hi>Cap,</hi> 7. he willeth the ſame, where he intendeth, that infinite time, nothing may paſs into infinite greatneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Furthermore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his firſt Book, <hi>de Calo,</hi> confirmeth the ſame, ſaying ſimply, that the Reaſon or Conſideration of times, is contrary to the reaſon of weights; as if half a weight be moved in this time, the double is moved in the half of this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. furthermore, <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. of the ſame Book he ſaith, the Fire in as much as it is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Earth, ſo much the ſooner and ſwiftlyer it cometh to its reſting place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Alſo in his Second Book, <hi>de Calo, Cap.</hi> 8. he ſaith thus: As in other things, the greater Body is the more ſwiftly moved by his proper courſe or motion, even ſo alſo in the Heavenly Circles, and again <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the ſame in two places, ſaying that the greater Earth, is ſwiftlyer moved.</p>

Alſo, whereas are two equal Angles about the Horizon, or under, but in contrary motion of Nature, becauſe violent motion is ſwifter in the begining than in the end, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary chanceth in the motion of Nature: for with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motion, the motion of Nature is ever ſomewhat mixt, if Horizontically or Angulerly it ſhall be above or beneath the Horizon: and Nature worketh ſo much, until it bring violent motion to ſome end. But if the Perpendicularly Violence ſhall be made about the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and towards the place which that body naturally

Wherfore in the havineſs the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time taken away, in the which the motion of that body in the Air, by equal ſpace to that, by the which in Water to the time wherein by Water in the granted ſpace is moved, the proportion ſhall be ſubtriple, and not ſubduple, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirmeth. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the ſame Chapter, ſuppoſing that if motion ſhould be granted in voide, the ſame or all one, ſhould be the reaſon of time to time, as is between moving bodies, which is impoſſible by the aforeſaid. For thoſe bodies ſhould be moved is equal time, although they ſhould be of divers kinds, forms and bigneſs. By which place alſo is eaſie to gather, that the mind of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was, that the proportion of motion to motion, is the ſame thing which greatneſſes have between them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the heavineſs and lightneſs ſimply. But that this alſo may the more clearly be underſtood, imagine the bodies <hi>M</hi> and <hi>N</hi> in void, and that the body <hi>N</hi> be of the ſame weight which <hi>A V I,</hi> but of divers kinds, and conſequently of divers bigneſs: then whereas thoſe bodies have no reſiſtance, there is no doubt but that they ſhall be moved by equal time, by equal ſpace.

Therefore if we ſhall ſee any Star above the ender of the ſight, we ſhould not therefore think it to be in the twelfth ſtation of Heaven (this is to be underſtood by reaſonable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) for the Virtue of the Star appeareth chiefly in the great Circle (whoſe Pole is <hi>Zenith</hi>) paſſing by the 90 Degree of the Equinoctial, from the Interſection or dividing of the ſame with the Meridian toward the Eaſt. Furthermore, the difference between the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ſight, and the greater Circle, is not only one Diameter of the Star, but of Degrees, which if it were not, we could by no means uſe the Propoſition 49 of <hi>Vitellio:</hi> and therefore it was no ſmall Error of them that ſaid that the Horizon is the ender of the fight. and one of the greateſt Circles in the Sphere, and that ever the middle of Heaven appeareth unto us, for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more then half appeareth unto us; for the Incurvation or crooking of the Beams. But he that will ſee more Examples of theſe things, let him read the 4th Book of <hi>Vitellio,</hi> and the Tenth, and in ſome parts the Second and 5th of the ſame, in all of which he ſhall ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what how eaſily we may be deceived by this ſenſe, but the like of other Senſes is not to be doubted. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not without weak and ſlender judgment, they call <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſo Divine a Prince of Phyloſophy, and Divine <hi>Peter Arches,</hi> did very wiſely give Commendation to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proportionally and no further, but only to God; foraſmuch as it is humane to err, <hi>Aristotle</hi> alſo might ſometime fail.</p>
                  <p>We having thus throughly diſcourſed of Proportions Local, we ſhall now next fall upon the ſwift Motion by the Art of Navigation, which will occaſion us to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe many rare Mathematical Secrets.</p>

                  <p>This moſt ſwift Motion to the common ſort of men ſeemeth incredible, for that the ſame may be done by ſailing in a Ship or other Veſſell, againſt whatſoever courſe of any Outragious Flood or River, and againſt the moſt furious Winds whatſoever they are, even alſo in the deepeſt Winter, and greateſt Sourges of Water. Neither is it ſtrange, if it be incredible to the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert. For the common people count that for a Miracle, which the expert Mathematicians know to be natural and eaſie: for if it ſhould be propounded to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, that any man might in the midſt of the Waters and Floods, deſcend to the bottom of the River <hi>Rhene,</hi> his Apparel remaining dry, and no part of Body wet, and alſo to bring with him burning fire from the bottom of the Water, it ſhould ſeem to them to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and an impoſſibility: Which nevertheleſs in the year 1538. in <hi>Toleto</hi> a City of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the moſt ſwift River <hi>Tagus</hi> (in which the Gold is ſaid to be found) running through the courſe of the Sun, none otherwiſe then <hi>Danubus,</hi> and three other in the World, making their courſe from the Weſt to the Eaſt, which ſtrange fight twelve thouſand Perſons ſaw in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, the fifth of that Name. Of ſuch ſtrange Experiments I ſhall not need here to ſpeak much. Others there be that dare affirm, that a certain Ship was in ſuch ſort driven with violent Winds and furious Seas, with ſuch a ſwift courſe, that the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot ſtanding in the Keel of the Ship, near unto the Maſt, ſhooting an Arrow out of a Croſs-bow, the Arrow fell down before his Feet, and came not ſo far as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part or fore-caſtle of the Ship. I have heard alſo of credible men, that a certain Pilot <hi>Cantabrian,</hi> lying at an Anchor at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> on a certain Sunday after morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayer, departed with full Sailes and proſperous Winds until he came to the Coaſt of St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtella,</hi> and immediately returning with like proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Winds came again to <hi>Antwerp</hi> in the ſame Ship
<pb facs="tcp:187773:87"/> the <hi>Sunday</hi> next following. The which I deny not but may be done, yet not without great danger of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, eſpecially in the return, the wind being at the South. Alſo in the year 1551. there was Experience made of a moſt ſwift Motion; For, from <hi>Drepan</hi> of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia</hi> and <hi>Trinacria,</hi> the Port of the Gales of <hi>Maltha</hi> (now being in the place of the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> otherwiſe called of St. <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) A certain Ship without ever ſtriking Sail, in 37 hours arrived at <hi>Naples.</hi> And yet are theſe places diſtant in Latitude almoſt five degrees, beſides ſome part of Longitude: which on the Earth correſpondeth and amounteth to four hundred and five Miles. The motions are cauſed by violent Floods and outragious Winds. The like alſo may be done againſt the fury of Winds and the violence of Floods, when need ſhall be for expedite carriage of Victuales by Sea, and even in places where it is hard to come to Land, and this with ſmall labour, as hereafter I will plainly declare by Demonſtration: but oftentimes, moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Pilots and Sea-men do marvail that Sailing in Ships of the ſelf ſame making, weight, content, or capacity, framed alſo of the ſame Shipwright, furniſhed with equal Sails, and all other things appertaing, yet to be of ſuch diverſe ſwiftneſs, that the one cannot keep equal courſe with the other, which admiration doubtleſs muſt proceed through ſome ignorance or want of knowledge of the due proportion of the frame of all ſorts of Ships: that is the depth, bredth, height and length, (named by the Maſter Sea-men, Latitude, Longitude, Altitude and Profunditie) the which if they are unknown of the Maſter Carpenter or Shipwright, two Ships can never be ſo directed by equal courſe, but that one ſhall be ſwifter than another: and this doubtleſs only by reaſon of their different proportion in their framing, making, or architecture.</p>

                  <p>I have oftentimes attempted by Mathematical reaſon, how and in what manner a commodious faſhion of Ships may be Invented with ſmall labour, and as little as may be of coſt, which may in ſhort time ſtrive againſt the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:187773:88"/> courſe of whatſoever ſtrong Floods or Rivers, as <hi>Rhene, Danubie, Moſella, Scalda,</hi> and infinite others of our own and other Countreys, boyling and overflowing through the abundance of great Showres, melted Snows and furious Winds, and this more eſpecially for the commodity of ſpeedy tranſporting of Victuals, and ſuch other neceſſaries: in conſideration whereof, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion firſt obſerved, and the ſaid Ship or Veſſel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt finiſhed, then muſt be made three holes from the Keele, towards the forecaſtle or foremoſt part of the Ship, as appeareth in the figure by the Letters <hi>ABC.</hi> In which holes, in time of the courſe, certain Engines of ſtrange and marvellous invention may be faſtened. In the poupe or hinder part of the Ship, may be prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (after the manner of <hi>Germany</hi>) a little Stove or Hot-Houſe, where Paſſengers may commodiouſly reſt, now the Ship being thus prepared, the bottom thereof ſhould be dreſt with Tallow; and not with Tarr, that it may move the ſwiftlyer.</p>
                  <p>Thus having conſidered of the proportion and frame of the ſaid Ship, the reſt of the Mechanical or Handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft Work, we leave to the Carpenters and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights.</p>
                  <p>It chanceth oftentimes, and that more eſpecially in Winter, that certain Floods and Rivers overflown with too much abundance of waters, do through their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence refuſe all Navigations that may be made againſt their courſe, to the great damage and hurt of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of many Towns and Cities, to the which they ſhould carry Victuals and other Proviſions, againſt the courſe of the Rivers: And therefore in ſavour of the Commonwealth, I have invented theſe kind of Ships, that I may hereby, as by my Seal, confirm the good will I bear to our poſterity. Now therefore it may ſuffice to have ſaid thus much of this ſwift motion which I have proved with my own ſtrength of reaſon, and ſufficiently declared the framing and uſe thereof: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it may be eaſie for expert men to add more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:187773:89"/> to the excellency of their Wits and Cunning. For in all Sciences it is eaſier to add to Inventions, then to Invent. Let us now not only conſider what commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity this may bring to our ſelves, but alſo to the <hi>Braban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> Sayling from <hi>Antuerp</hi> to <hi>Bruxells</hi> in the new River: for that which they attempt dangerouſly with great vexation and ſhogging in Wagons by foul and tedious Journeys, often wet to the Skin for the ſpace of a whole day, may by Water be done more conveniently, in the ſpace of four or five hours even againſt the River and Wind.</p>
                  <p>And leaſt the Reader ſhould ſeem to refute our ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, while he thinks that thoſe things which he eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for Miracles, to exceed the Limits of Nature, I will ſhew manifeſtly by one Demonſtration of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Enterpriſer, the manner how he deſcended to the bottom of the River, his body remaining dry as before I have affirmed. But here firſt let us conſider, that naturally the Water or Sea (as other Elements) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to a Sperical form, and with its globoſitie or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, overpaſſeth moſt high Mountains. But hear again will ariſe another doubt to the inexpert. That is, If the Sea be higher than the Land, how is it then that it doth not drown and cover the Earth, whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the drineſs of the Earth may ſo long reſiſt the moiſtneſs of the Water, untill it receive or imbibe too much moiſtneſs, which may thus be naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Fill a Cup, a Glaſs, or other Veſſel with Water or Wine to the brim, ſo that the fulneſs thereof may ſeem to ſwell as if it would overflow the brim of the Cup. Then may you yet put therein many pieces of Gold, without ſhedding one drop of Water. But if the extreamity of the brim be once wet, immediately the Water overfloweth, becauſe the drineſs of the Veſſel doth participate of the moiſtneſs of the Water: which is yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> better proved in the manner as followeth: Take a certain quantity of Water and ſprinkle it by drops up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no a dry (or duſty) Table: ſo ſhall the drops partly
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:187773:89"/> ſhew a Sperical form remaining; but if the Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be never ſo little wet with Water, the drops ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereon, ſhall float abroad, and keep no ſperical or round form, by reaſon of the moiſture that the Table hath received before of the Water. It hath oftentimes happened that certain Towns and Lands have been drowned by the Rivers overflowing near unto them. Nevertheleſs, how much ſoever ſuch Waters increaſe or riſe, there is no danger, untill great Showres falling from Heaven, do thorowly wet the Banks, Ramperts and Calſeys of ſuch Rivers. For when they (as we have ſaid) are thorowly imbibed with moiſtneſs, they cauſe the overflowing and breach, whereof followeth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing and drowning of the Region: And this may ſuffice for Advertiſement. Now I ſhall inſtance the aforeſaid experiment ſhewed at <hi>Toleto</hi> by two <hi>Gre ks:</hi> who taking a Chalderon of great Capacity, the Mouth turned downwards, and ſo hanging it in the Air by Ropes, they faſtened certain Boards, Poſts, or Shelves in the middeſt of the Chaldron, where they placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the fire. Then to make it hang ſtedfaſtly and equally, they compaſſed the Circumference, brim, or border thereof with Leaden Plummets, every ſide equally, and made of equal weight, leaſt any part of the circumference of the mouth of the Chaldron, except it were equally &amp; ſoftly let down into the water, ſhould ſooner touch the water then the whole circumference. For ſo ſhould the water eaſily overcome the air incloſed in the chaldron, and reſolve it into moiſture. But if by due proportion the Chaldron thus prepared, be fair and ſoftly let down into the water, the air incloſed in the chaldron (by reſiſtance of the water) ſhall violently make it ſelf place, not admitting the water to enter. So the men there incloſed, ſhall ſo long remain dry in the middeſt of the water, untill ſucceſs of time do by reſpiration debilitate and conſume the incloſed Air, turning it into groſs humidity, ingroſſed by the coldneſs and moiſtneſs of the water: but if in due time the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:187773:90"/> be ſoftly and equally drawn out of the water, the men ſhall remain dry and the fire not extinct, as it was then experimented, which alſo may be thus proved: take a Cup or Glaſs of a certain quantity: the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the mouth whereof, ſhall be broader then the circumference of the bottom. In the mouth let be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened a little ſtick, tying thereunto a thread: on the ſtick, faſten a little candle of wax, whoſe light may come only to the middeſt of the cup, leaſt as much nearneſs of the water might ſuffocate the candle. Then propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably (as in the former experiment) put the cup with a burning candle into a Veſſel full of water, and in due time draw it out ſoftly and equally, ſo that no part of the mouth of the circumference thereof be drawn out before the whole, or ſpeedily, ſo ſhall the candle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in extinct. Let not therefore the Ignorant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our writings, before they know what may be done by experience, it is now no miracle, when it is known to be natural: and thus it is in all other Sciences and Experiments, which the common people think to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. As that the ſalt water of the Sea may be made freſh, and Potable to be drunk; which nevertheleſs may be done naturally, as hath been often proved divers ways. Some do this (as is written in <hi>Gemma Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phica</hi>) putting the ſalt water in a Veſſel plaiſtered or cruſted over with clean wax, which diſtilling through the ſtrait or narrow pores thereof, leaveth the ſalt, which for its groſſneſs cannot paſs thereby. The ſame may be done better by a Canon or Pipe, filled with Gravel or little ſtones, that the ſalt water poured thereon may divers times paſs through that Pipe into another Veſſel.</p>

                  <p>And foraſmuch as I have made mention of ſundry In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, it ſhall not be from the purpoſe, to deſcribe the goodly Inſtrument whereof <hi>Angelus Politianus</hi> in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:187773:92"/> his fourth Book of Epiſtles to <hi>Franciſcus Caſo,</hi> where he writeth in this manner, I have received your Epiſtle, wherein you ſignify to me, that you have heard of the ſtrange Engine or Inſtrument <hi>Antomatan</hi> invented, and made of late by one <hi>Lawrence</hi> a <hi>Florentine;</hi> in the which is expreſſed the courſe and motions of the Planets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable and agreeable with the motions of Heaven, and foraſmuch <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> as the report thereof is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed, you greatly deſire that I ſhould write to you, what certain Knowledge I have of that thing, wherein I am ready to obey your Requeſt. And altho' now it be long ſince I ſaw it, yet as far as I bear in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, I will briefly expreſs to you the Form, Reaſon, and Uſe thereof. And if the Deſcription thereof ſhall ſeem to you to be ſomewhat obſcure, you ſhall not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it altogether to my Declaration, but partly to the ſubtlety and Novelty of the thing. It is in form of a ſquare Pillar, ſharp towards the top, in the manner of a <hi>Pyramidis,</hi> of height almoſt three Cubits: over and above it in manner of a baner, is a flat or plain round of guilded Copper, adorned with ſundry Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, on whoſe other part is expreſſed the whole courſe of the Planets, and whole Dimenſion or Meaſure is ſomewhat ſhorter then a Cubit, and is within turned and moved with certain little Denticle Wheels, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Circle comprehending the higheſt Border or Margent, divided with the ſpaces of 24 hours within it, in the higheſt turning Roundel, the twelve ſigns are diſcerned by three Degrees. Further, within are ſeen eight Rundels, in manner of one greatneſs, of theſe two obtain the middle point, the one faſtened in the other, ſo that the loweſt being ſomewhat bigger, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth the Sun, and the higher the Moon. From the Sun a beam coming to the circle, ſheweth in it the hours: and in the Zodia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k, the Months, days, and number of Degrees, and alſo the true and half Motion of the Sun. From the Moon alſo proceedeth a Pin, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>yer, which beneath or downward in the Border or
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:187773:92"/> Margent of the greateſt Rundel, ſheweth the hours: and paſſing by the Center of the Epicide of the Moon, and extending to the Zodiack, ſheweth the half Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Planet. Another alſo riſing from thence, and cutting the border of the Center of the Moon (that is of the Epicide) ſheweth her true place, whereby are ſeen the ſlowneſs, ſwiftneſs, all Motions and Courſes, Conjunctions alſo and full Moons. About theſe are ſix other Rundels, of the which, one whom they call the Head and Tail of the Dragon, ſheweth the Ecclipſes both of the Sun and the Moon. The other are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Planets; from every one of which, proceed two points, aſſigning the Motions (as we have ſaid) of the Moon, but they alſo go backward, which chanceth not in the Moon, whoſe Ecclipſe is moved contrariwiſe. And thus the reaſon of Conjunctions, Departings, and Latitudes is manifeſt in all. There is alſo another Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der likewiſe to the Zodiack, cutting or dividing upward or above, thoſe ſix little Rundels of the Planets, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by appeareth the Degrees of the Eaſt ſigns, and the ſpaces of the days (that is to ſay) at what hour the Sun riſeth, by the which, every one of the Planets are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in their Rundels or Circles by courſe, in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to the Eaſt, and in the Night to the Weſt. Again contrariwiſe, the greateſt Rundel of all, draweth with it all the Planets, in the Night to the Eaſt, and in the day to the Weſt, in the ſpace of 24 hours. All which to agree with the Motions of the Heavens, both Reaſon and Experience do confirm; and therefore we ought not to marvel if theſe things ſeem incredible to many. (For as ſaith the wiſe Proverb) Faith is ſlowly given to great things, for even we ſcarcely believe our own Eyes, when we ſee ſuch things. And therefore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in time paſt I read, that ſuch a like Inſtrument was made by <hi>Archimedes,</hi> my Faith yet failed to give Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to ſo great an Author, which thing nevertheleſs this our <hi>Florentine</hi> hath performed. The work doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs being of ſuch an Excellence, that all praiſe is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:187773:93"/> to it, and cannot otherwiſe for the worthineſs thereof, be otherwiſe praiſed, then to ſay that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all praiſe; inſomuch that he may ſeem a man ſent from Heaven, where he learnt the making of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Hitherto <hi>Politianus.</hi> Of the like Inſtrument, <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> maketh mention, affirming the ſame to be worth a Kingdom to a wiſe man. But foraſmuch as the Subject I have diſcourſed of is chiefly touching Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appertaining to Ships, and the Art of Navigation, I ſhall here think it fit to ſay ſomething of the Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a certain <hi>Italian</hi> Writer <hi>Leonardo Fiorauanti,</hi> who in his Book Intituled, <hi>Specchio di Scientia <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſale,</hi> doth greatly glory in the Invention of Ships, which cannot periſh either on the Sea, or the Land, affirming the like was neuer invented ſince the Creation of the World. But I fear, leaſt his vain Glory of diſcourſing in the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian</hi> Tongue, hath cauſed him more then needs, to commend his own invention. Therefore commiting the judgment hereof to men of greater Experience and Knowledge in theſe things, I will only tranſlate his Words, whereby in the book before-named, he deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the ſame Ship in this manner. Take Beams of Fur or Pine-tree, which of their own nature can never ſink or go down, or remain under the Water, and with theſe Beams frame an Engine or Machine, of the length of threeſcore foot, and of the height of ſix foot, and of the breadth of twenty foot, laying the firſt rank in length, faſhioning the fore-part like unto other Ships, and in like manner, bringing the poop or hinder part to good Form; then with ſuch Irons as appertain bind it, and ſtrengthen it in ſuch manner as it cannot break. And upon this Frame or Foundation build your Ship, of ſuch faſhion as you think beſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But whether the Frame or Foundation ſhould be builded upon the Keel or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Ship, or otherwiſe (as I have ſaid) I muſt commit it to them of better judgment. But leaſt I ſhould be unmindful of my Promiſe, concerning the rare Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrician <hi>Beſon,</hi> that cauſed a book to be Printed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:187773:93"/> the Forms and Portracts of 60 Engines of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous ſtrange and profitable Device, of which I only mentioned three foraſmuch as they chiefly appertain to Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> the 54, 57, 60. I ſhall here make a brief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſal of them, the 54 therefore (as he writeth) is an Engine not unlike to that which <hi>Archimedes</hi> in former time invented for the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> wherewith a man with the ſtrength of only one hand, by help of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument called <hi>Triſpacton</hi> (which in our Tongue ſome call an endleſs ſcrue) brought a Ship of marvellous great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the Land into the the Sea, in the ſight of King <hi>Hieron,</hi> and an infinite Multitude which with all their force could not do the ſame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of which alſo our Countrey-man <hi>Roger Bacon,</hi> a great Philoſopher ſeemed to have had ſome Knowledge: he making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Inſtrument no bigger then a mans body, wherewith one man might draw to him the ſtrength of three hundred men. And when I was in <hi>France</hi> I heard credibly reported that an <hi>Almain</hi> made an Engine, where with one at 15 years of Age lifted from the ground a weight, which the ſtrongeſt man in the Court was not able to remove. Almoſt the ſame device we ſee in the bending of a Croſs-bow. Alſo at my being in <hi>Germany</hi> in the City of <hi>Straſburgh,</hi> a worthy Gentleman, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Saleno,</hi> told me that in that City one had inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Engine of Iron, no bigger than a mans hand, whereunto faſtening a Rope, with a hook of Iron, no bigger than a mans head, and caſting the hook upon a Wall, Tree, or other place, where it might take hold, he could with that Engine lift himſelf up to the Wall, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. But to return to the other two Engines of <hi>Beſon,</hi> pertaining to our purpoſe, The 60 Figure (as he there writeth) is the Invention of an Engine, ſcarcely credible, wherewith by Ballance and eaſie Motion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the order of Nature, a Ship ma be ordered and governed, that in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alm Sea it ſhall move forwards, and in little Wind haſten the courſe, and in too much Wind, temper and moderate the ſame; a Secret (as he
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:187773:94"/> ſaith) worth the Knowledge of a Prince. Of the third Engine which is the 57 of his Book, he writeth thus, an Artifice not yet divulged or ſet forth, which placed in the poop of a Ship, whither the Water hath Recourſe, and moved by the Motion of the Ship with Wheels and Weights, doth exactly ſhew what ſpace the Ship hath gone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which Deſcription, ſome do underſtand that the Knowledge of the Longitude might ſo be found a thing doubtleſs greatly to be deſired, and hitherto not certainly known, altho' <hi>Sebastian Cabot</hi> on his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, told me he had the Knowledge of the ſame by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, yet ſo, that he might not teach any Man. But I think that the good old man, in his extream Age, ſomewhat doted, and had not yet even in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Death, utterly ſhaken off all worldly vain Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As touching which Knowledge of the Longitude, to ſpeak a little more by occaſion now given, it ſhall not be from the purpoſe, for to rehearſe the Words of that Excellent Learned man, <hi>Joannes Fernelius,</hi> in his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Book <hi>de abditis rerum cauſis,</hi> where in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> he writeth thus, we have put our helping hand to the Art of Navigation and Geography; for by the Obſervation of the hours of the Equinoctials, we have invented how in whatſoever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or place of the World a man ſhall be, he may know in what Longitude it is; which certainly we have not taken from the Fountains of the Ancients, but firſt of all (as I think) have drawn it out of our own Rivers, as our own Invention. I ſhall conclude (as I ſaid before) that which way ſoever we turn our Eyes, we may ſee that Poſterity hath not riotouſly waſted the Inheritance of Arts and Sciences, left them by their Predeceſſors, but have greatly improved and increaſe the ſame, and alſo invented others.</p>
